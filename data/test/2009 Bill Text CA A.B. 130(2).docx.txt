Digest                            LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST AB 130, as amended, Jeffries.  Identity theft.   VITAL RECORDS: MARRIAGE RECORDS.   (1) EXISTING LAW PRESCRIBES SPECIFIED PERSONAL INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED ON BIRTH, DEATH, AND MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES. UNDER EXISTING LAW, A CERTIFIED COPY OF A BIRTH OR DEATH RECORD MAY ONLY BE SUPPLIED BY THE STATE REGISTRAR, LOCAL REGISTRAR, OR COUNTY RECORDER TO AN AUTHORIZED PERSON, AS DEFINED, WHO SUBMITS A STATEMENT SWORN UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE APPLICANT IS AN AUTHORIZED PERSON. IF AN APPLICANT FOR A BIRTH OR DEATH RECORD DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN AUTHORIZED PERSON, THE STATE REGISTRAR, LOCAL REGISTRAR, OR COUNTY RECORDER MAY ONLY ISSUE AN INFORMATIONAL CERTIFIED COPY OF A BIRTH OR DEATH RECORD THAT CONTAINS A LEGEND STATING ""INFORMATIONAL, NOT A VALID DOCUMENT TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY.""   EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES THAT EACH CERTIFIED COPY OF A BIRTH OR DEATH RECORD CONTAIN SPECIFIED INFORMATION AND BE PRINTED ON SENSITIZED PAPER WITH SPECIFIED FEATURES.   EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES AN APPLICANT FOR A CERTIFIED COPY OF A BIRTH OR DEATH RECORD TO PAY, IN ADDITION TO OTHER FEES APPLICABLE TO THE RECEIPT OF A COPY OF A BIRTH OR DEATH RECORD FROM THE STATE REGISTRAR, LOCAL REGISTRAR OR COUNTY RECORDER A FEE OF $ 1, TO BE USED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT AGAINST THE FRAUDULENT USE OF THESE RECORDS AND DEFRAY THE COST TO LOCAL OFFICIALS OF ANY REQUIRED SECURITY MEASURES.   THIS BILL WOULD ALSO MAKE THESE PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO A REQUEST FOR A CERTIFIED COPY OF A MARRIAGE RECORD, AND WOULD MAKE CONFORMING CHANGES. BY CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF THE CRIME OF PERJURY, AND BY IMPOSING NEW DUTIES ON LOCAL OFFICIALS, THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A STATE-MANDATED LOCAL PROGRAM.   (2) EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THE STATE REGISTRAR TO APPOINT A VITAL RECORDS PROTECTION ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO STUDY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY, INHIBIT IDENTITY THEFT, AND PREVENT FRAUD INVOLVING BIRTH AND DEATH CERTIFICATES WHILE PROVIDING NEEDED ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THOSE RECORDS BY PERSONS SEEKING IT FOR A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE.   THIS BILL WOULD ADD MARRIAGE RECORDS TO THE LIST OF VITAL RECORDS UNDER THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION FOR STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS.   (3) EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THE STATE REGISTRAR TO MAINTAIN COMPREHENSIVE INDICES OF REGISTERED CERTIFICATES. UNDER EXISTING LAW, COMPREHENSIVE BIRTH AND DEATH RECORD INDICES, AS PRESCRIBED, MUST BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND ARE EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. EXISTING LAW ALSO PROHIBITS SPECIFIED USES OF BIRTH AND DEATH RECORD FILES. VIOLATION OF THESE PROVISIONS IS A MISDEMEANOR.   THIS BILL WOULD APPLY THESE PROVISIONS TO COMPREHENSIVE MARRIAGE INDICES. BY CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF A CRIME, AND BY IMPOSING NEW DUTIES ON LOCAL OFFICIALS, THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A STATE-MANDATED LOCAL PROGRAM.   (4) THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE STATE TO REIMBURSE LOCAL AGENCIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR CERTAIN COSTS MANDATED BY THE STATE. STATUTORY PROVISIONS ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR MAKING THAT REIMBURSEMENT.   THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE THAT WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN MANDATES NO REIMBURSEMENT IS REQUIRED BY THIS ACT FOR A SPECIFIED REASON.   WITH REGARD TO ANY OTHER MANDATES, THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE THAT, IF THE COMMISSION ON STATE MANDATES DETERMINES THAT THE BILL CONTAINS COSTS SO MANDATED BY THE STATE, REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE COSTS SHALL BE MADE PURSUANT TO THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS NOTED ABOVE.   Existing law establishes various offenses in connection with the unlawful acquisition or use of personal identifying information. Some of these offenses are punishable only as misdemeanors, however most may be prosecuted as misdemeanors or as felonies punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years.   This bill would provide that a 2nd or subsequent commission of any of these offenses would be punishable by a fine, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both a fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or 4 years.   By providing that certain misdemeanors are punishable as a felony, thereby increasing the duties of local prosecutors, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.   This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.  Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: yes.
