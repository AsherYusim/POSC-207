Digest                            LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST AB 2234, as amended, Bonnie Lowenthal. Mental health: target populations: older adults. Existing law, the Bronzan-McCorquodale Act, contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs. Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, establishes the Mental Health Services Fund to fund various county mental health programs. The act may be amended by the Legislature only by a 2/3 vote of both houses and only so long as the amendment is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act. The Legislature may clarify procedures and terms of the act by majority vote. Existing law, the Adult and Older Adult Mental Health System of Care Act, sets out a system of mental health care services, provided by participating counties pursuant to Proposition 63, for adults and older adults with serious mental disorders. Existing law defines serious mental disorders and includes a definition of functional impairment for that purpose. This bill would make the current definition of functional impairment applicable to adults 18 to 59 years of age, inclusive, and would, in addition, establish a definition of functional impairment for adults 60 years of age or older. The bill would also make  eligible for services pursuant to this program adults 60 years of age or older who require brief treatment as a result of a natural disaster or severe local emergency   CONFORMING CHANGES  . By expanding eligibility for community mental health services, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. Vote: 2/3. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: yes. Text THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1170.9 OF THE PENAL CODE IS AMENDED TO READ:  In the case of any person convicted of a criminal offense who would otherwise be sentenced to county jail or state prison and who alleges that he or she committed the offense as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or psychological problems stemming from service in a combat theater in the United States military, the court shall, prior to sentencing, hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant was a member of the military forces of the United States who served in combat and shall assess whether the defendant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or psychological problems as a result of that service. If the court concludes that a defendant convicted of a criminal offense is a person described in subdivision (a), and if the defendant is otherwise eligible for probation and the court places the defendant on probation, the court may order the defendant into a local, state, federal, or private nonprofit treatment program for a period not to exceed that which the defendant would have served in state prison or county jail, provided the defendant agrees to participate in the program and the court determines that an appropriate treatment program exists. If a referral is made to the county mental health authority, the county shall be obligated to provide mental health treatment services only to the extent that resources are available for that purpose, as described in  paragraph (5) of  subdivision  (b)   (E)  of Section 5600.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. If mental health treatment services are ordered by the court, the county mental health agency shall coordinate appropriate referral of the defendant to the county veterans service officer, as described in  paragraph (5) of  subdivision  (b)   (E)  of Section 5600.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The county mental health agency shall not be responsible for providing services outside its traditional scope of services. An order shall be made referring a defendant to a county mental health agency only if that agency has agreed to accept responsibility for the treatment of the defendant. When determining the ""needs of the defendant,"" for purposes of Section 1202.7, the court shall consider the fact that the defendant is a person described in subdivision (a) in assessing whether the defendant should be placed on probation and whether the defendant would be best served while on probation by being ordered into a private nonprofit treatment service program with a demonstrated history of specializing in the treatment of military service-related issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or psychological problems. A defendant granted probation under this section and committed to a residential treatment program shall earn sentence credits for the actual time the defendant served in residential treatment. The court, in making an order under this section to commit a defendant to an established treatment program, shall give preference to a treatment program that has a history of successfully treating combat veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or psychological problems as a result of that service. SECTION 5346 OF THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE IS AMENDED TO READ:  In any county in which services are available as provided in Section 5348, a court may order a person who is the subject of a petition filed pursuant to this section to obtain assisted outpatient treatment if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the facts stated in the verified petition filed in accordance with this section are true and establish that all of the requisite criteria set forth in this section are met, including, but not limited to, each of the following: The person is 18 years of age or older. The person is suffering from a mental illness as defined in  paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b)   SUBDIVISION (B) OR (C)  of Section 5600.3. There has been a clinical determination that the person is unlikely to survive safely in the community without supervision. The person has a history of lack of compliance with treatment for his or her mental illness, in that at least one of the following is true: The person's mental illness has, at least twice within the last 36 months, been a substantial factor in necessitating hospitalization, or receipt of services in a forensic or other mental health unit of a state correctional facility or local correctional facility, not including any period during which the person was hospitalized or incarcerated immediately preceding the filing of the petition. The person's mental illness has resulted in one or more acts of serious and violent behavior toward himself or herself or another, or threats, or attempts to cause serious physical harm to himself or herself or another within the last 48 months, not including any period in which the person was hospitalized or incarcerated immediately preceding the filing of the petition. The person has been offered an opportunity to participate in a treatment plan by the director of the local mental health department, or his or her designee, provided the treatment plan includes all of the services described in Section 5348, and the person continues to fail to engage in treatment. The person's condition is substantially deteriorating. Participation in the assisted outpatient treatment program would be the least restrictive placement necessary to ensure the person's recovery and stability. In view of the person's treatment history and current behavior, the person is in need of assisted outpatient treatment in order to prevent a relapse or deterioration that would be likely to result in grave disability or serious harm to himself or herself, or to others, as defined in Section 5150. It is likely that the person will benefit from assisted outpatient treatment. A petition for an order authorizing assisted outpatient treatment may be filed by the county mental health director, or his or her designee, in the superior court in the county in which the person who is the subject of the petition is present or reasonably believed to be present. A request may be made only by any of the following persons to the county mental health department for the filing of a petition to obtain an order authorizing assisted outpatient treatment: Any person 18 years of age or older with whom the person who is the subject of the petition resides. Any person who is the parent, spouse, or sibling or child 18 years of age or older of the person who is the subject of the petition. The director of any public or private agency, treatment facility, charitable organization, or licensed residential care facility providing mental health services to the person who is the subject of the petition in whose institution the subject of the petition resides. The director of a hospital in which the person who is the subject of the petition is hospitalized. A licensed mental health treatment provider who is either supervising the treatment of, or treating for a mental illness, the person who is the subject of the petition. A peace officer, parole officer, or probation officer assigned to supervise the person who is the subject of the petition. Upon receiving a request pursuant to paragraph (2), the county mental health director shall conduct an investigation into the appropriateness of the filing of the petition. The director shall file the petition only if he or she determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that all the necessary elements to sustain the petition can be proven in a court of law by clear and convincing evidence. The petition shall state all of the following: Each of the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment as set forth in subdivision (a). Facts that support the petitioner's belief that the person who is the subject of the petition meets each criterion, provided that the hearing on the petition shall be limited to the stated facts in the verified petition, and the petition contains all the grounds on which the petition is based, in order to ensure adequate notice to the person who is the subject of the petition and his or her counsel. That the person who is the subject of the petition is present, or is reasonably believed to be present, within the county where the petition is filed. That the person who is the subject of the petition has the right to be represented by counsel in all stages of the proceeding under the petition, in accordance with subdivision (c). The petition shall be accompanied by an affidavit of a licensed mental health treatment provider designated by the local mental health director who shall state, if applicable, either of the following: That the licensed mental health treatment provider has personally examined the person who is the subject of the petition no more than 10 days prior to the submission of the petition, the facts and reasons why the person who is the subject of the petition meets the criteria in subdivision (a), that the licensed mental health treatment provider recommends assisted outpatient treatment for the person who is the subject of the petition, and that the licensed mental health treatment provider is willing and able to testify at the hearing on the petition. That no more than 10 days prior to the filing of the petition, the licensed mental health treatment provider, or his or her designee, has made appropriate attempts to elicit the cooperation of the person who is the subject of the petition, but has not been successful in persuading that person to submit to an examination, that the licensed mental health treatment provider has reason to believe that the person who is the subject of the petition meets the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment, and that the licensed mental health treatment provider is willing and able to examine the person who is the subject of the petition and testify at the hearing on the petition. The person who is the subject of the petition shall have the right to be represented by counsel at all stages of a proceeding commenced under this section. If the person so elects, the court shall immediately appoint the public defender or other attorney to assist the person in all stages of the proceedings. The person shall pay the cost of the legal services if he or she is able. Upon receipt by the court of a petition submitted pursuant to subdivision (b), the court shall fix the date for a hearing at a time not later than five days from the date the petition is received by the court, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The petitioner shall promptly cause service of a copy of the petition, together with written notice of the hearing date, to be made personally on the person who is the subject of the petition, and shall send a copy of the petition and notice to the county office of patient rights, and to the current health care provider appointed for the person who is the subject of the petition, if any such provider is known to the petitioner. Continuances shall be permitted only for good cause shown. In granting continuances, the court shall consider the need for further examination by a physician or the potential need to provide expeditiously assisted outpatient treatment. Upon the hearing date, or upon any other date or dates to which the proceeding may be continued, the court shall hear testimony. If it is deemed advisable by the court, and if the person who is the subject of the petition is available and has received notice pursuant to this section, the court may examine in or out of court the person who is the subject of the petition who is alleged to be in need of assisted outpatient treatment. If the person who is the subject of the petition does not appear at the hearing, and appropriate attempts to elicit the attendance of the person have failed, the court may conduct the hearing in the person's absence. If the hearing is conducted without the person present, the court shall set forth the factual basis for conducting the hearing without the person's presence. The court shall not order assisted outpatient treatment unless an examining licensed mental health treatment provider, who has personally examined, and has reviewed the available treatment history of, the person who is the subject of the petition within the time period commencing 10 days before the filing of the petition, testifies in person at the hearing. If the person who is the subject of the petition has refused to be examined by a licensed mental health treatment provider, the court may request that the person consent to an examination by a licensed mental health treatment provider appointed by the court. If the person who is the subject of the petition does not consent and the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the allegations in the petition are true, the court may order any person designated under Section 5150 to take into custody the person who is the subject of the petition and transport him or her, or cause him or her to be transported, to a hospital for examination by a licensed mental health treatment provider as soon as is practicable. Detention of the person who is the subject of the petition under the order may not exceed 72 hours. If the examination is performed by another licensed mental health treatment provider, the examining licensed mental health treatment provider may consult with the licensed mental health treatment provider whose affirmation or affidavit accompanied the petition regarding the issues of whether the allegations in the petition are true and whether the person meets the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment. The person who is the subject of the petition shall have all of the following rights: To adequate notice of the hearings to the person who is the subject of the petition, as well as to parties designated by the person who is the subject of the petition. To receive a copy of the court-ordered evaluation. To counsel. If the person has not retained counsel, the court shall appoint a public defender. To be informed of his or her right to judicial review by habeas corpus. To be present at the hearing unless he or she waives the right to be present. To present evidence. To call witnesses on his or her behalf. To cross-examine witnesses. To appeal decisions, and to be informed of his or her right to appeal. If after hearing all relevant evidence, the court finds that the person who is the subject of the petition does not meet the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment, the court shall dismiss the petition. If after hearing all relevant evidence, the court finds that the person who is the subject of the petition meets the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment, and there is no appropriate and feasible less restrictive alternative, the court may order the person who is the subject of the petition to receive assisted outpatient treatment for an initial period not to exceed six months. In fashioning the order, the court shall specify that the proposed treatment is the least restrictive treatment appropriate and feasible for the person who is the subject of the petition. The order shall state the categories of assisted outpatient treatment, as set forth in Section 5348, that the person who is the subject of the petition is to receive, and the court may not order treatment that has not been recommended by the examining licensed mental health treatment provider and included in the written treatment plan for assisted outpatient treatment as required by subdivision (e). If the person has executed an advance health care directive pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 4650) of Part 1 of Division 4.7 of the Probate Code, any directions included in the advance health care directive shall be considered in formulating the written treatment plan. If the person who is the subject of a petition for an order for assisted outpatient treatment pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (d) refuses to participate in the assisted outpatient treatment program, the court may order the person to meet with the assisted outpatient treatment team designated by the director of the assisted outpatient treatment program. The treatment team shall attempt to gain the person's cooperation with treatment ordered by the court. The person may be subject to a 72-hour hold pursuant to subdivision (f) only after the treatment team has attempted to gain the person's cooperation with treatment ordered by the court, and has been unable to do so. Assisted outpatient treatment shall not be ordered unless the licensed mental health treatment provider recommending assisted outpatient treatment to the court has submitted to the court a written treatment plan that includes services as set forth in Section 5348, and the court finds, in consultation with the county mental health director, or his or her designee, all of the following: That the services are available from the county, or a provider approved by the county, for the duration of the court order. That the services have been offered to the person by the local director of mental health, or his or her designee, and the person has been given an opportunity to participate on a voluntary basis, and the person has failed to engage in, or has refused, treatment. That all of the elements of the petition required by this article have been met. That the treatment plan will be delivered to the county director of mental health, or to his or her appropriate designee. If, in the clinical judgment of a licensed mental health treatment provider, the person who is the subject of the petition has failed or has refused to comply with the treatment ordered by the court, and, in the clinical judgment of the licensed mental health treatment provider, efforts were made to solicit compliance, and, in the clinical judgment of the licensed mental health treatment provider, the person may be in need of involuntary admission to a hospital for evaluation, the provider may request that persons designated under Section 5150 take into custody the person who is the subject of the petition and transport him or her, or cause him or her to be transported, to a hospital, to be held up to 72 hours for examination by a licensed mental health treatment provider to determine if the person is in need of treatment pursuant to Section 5150. Any continued involuntary retention in a hospital beyond the initial 72-hour period shall be pursuant to Section 5150. If at any time during the 72-hour period the person is determined not to meet the criteria of Section 5150, and does not agree to stay in the hospital as a voluntary patient, he or she shall be released and any subsequent involuntary detention in a hospital shall be pursuant to Section 5150. Failure to comply with an order of assisted outpatient treatment alone may not be grounds for involuntary civil commitment or a finding that the person who is the subject of the petition is in contempt of court. If the director of the assisted outpatient treatment program determines that the condition of the patient requires further assisted outpatient treatment, the director shall apply to the court, prior to the expiration of the period of the initial assisted outpatient treatment order, for an order authorizing continued assisted outpatient treatment for a period not to exceed 180 days from the date of the order. The procedures for obtaining any order pursuant to this subdivision shall be in accordance with subdivisions (a) to (f), inclusive. The period for further involuntary outpatient treatment authorized by any subsequent order under this subdivision may not exceed 180 days from the date of the order. At intervals of not less than 60 days during an assisted outpatient treatment order, the director of the outpatient treatment program shall file an affidavit with the court that ordered the outpatient treatment affirming that the person who is the subject of the order continues to meet the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment. At these times, the person who is the subject of the order shall have the right to a hearing on whether or not he or she still meets the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment if he or she disagrees with the director's affidavit. The burden of proof shall be on the director. During each 60-day period specified in subdivision (h), if the person who is the subject of the order believes that he or she is being wrongfully retained in the assisted outpatient treatment program against his or her wishes, he or she may file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, thus requiring the director of the assisted outpatient treatment program to prove that the person who is the subject of the order continues to meet the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment. Any person ordered to undergo assisted outpatient treatment pursuant to this article, who was not present at the hearing at which the order was issued, may immediately petition the court for a writ of habeas corpus. Treatment under the order for assisted outpatient treatment may not commence until the resolution of that petition. Section 5600.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: To the extent resources are available, the primary goal of the use of funds deposited in the mental health account of the local health and welfare trust fund should be to serve the target populations identified in the following categories, which shall not be construed as establishing an order of priority: Seriously emotionally disturbed children or adolescents.

A description of efforts to maximize the use of other state, federal, and local funds or services that can support and enhance the effectiveness of these programs. In order to reduce the cost of providing supportive housing for clients, counties that receive a grant pursuant to this part after January 1, 2004, shall enter into contracts with sponsors of supportive housing projects to the greatest extent possible. Participating counties are encouraged to commit a portion of their grants to rental assistance for a specified number of housing units in exchange for the counties' clients having the right of first refusal to rent the assisted units. In each year in which additional funding is provided by the annual Budget Act the department shall establish programs that offer individual counties sufficient funds to comprehensively serve severely mentally ill adults who are homeless, recently released from a county jail or the state prison, or others who are untreated, unstable, and at significant risk of incarceration or homelessness unless treatment is provided to them and who are severely mentally ill adults. For purposes of this subdivision, ""severely mentally ill adults"" are those individuals described in  subdivision (b)   SUBDIVISIONS (B) AND (C)  of Section 5600.3. In consultation with the advisory committee established pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), the department shall report to the Legislature on or before May 1 of each year in which additional funding is provided, and shall evaluate, at a minimum, the effectiveness of the strategies in providing successful outreach and reducing homelessness, involvement with local law enforcement, and other measures identified by the department. The evaluation shall include for each program funded in the current fiscal year as much of the following as available information permits: The number of persons served, and of those, the number who receive extensive community mental health services. The number of persons who are able to maintain housing, including the type of housing and whether it is emergency, transitional, or permanent housing, as defined by the department. The amount of grant funding spent on each type of housing. Other local, state, or federal funds or programs used to house clients. The number of persons with contacts with local law enforcement and the extent to which local and state incarceration has been reduced or avoided. The number of persons participating in employment service programs including competitive employment. The number of persons contacted in outreach efforts who appear to be severely mentally ill, as described in Section 5600.3, who have refused treatment after completion of all applicable outreach measures. The amount of hospitalization that has been reduced or avoided. The extent to which veterans identified through these programs' outreach are receiving federally funded veterans' services for which they are eligible. The extent to which programs funded for three or more years are making a measurable and significant difference on the street, in hospitals, and in jails, as compared to other counties or as compared to those counties in previous years. For those who have been enrolled in this program for at least two years and who were enrolled in Medi-Cal prior to, and at the time they were enrolled in, this program, a comparison of their Medi-Cal hospitalizations and other Medi-Cal costs for the two years prior to enrollment and the two years after enrollment in this program. The number of persons served who were and were not receiving Medi-Cal benefits in the 12-month period prior to enrollment and, to the extent possible, the number of emergency room visits and other medical costs for those not enrolled in Medi-Cal in the prior 12-month period. To the extent that state savings associated with providing integrated services for the mentally ill are quantified, it is the intent of the Legislature to capture those savings in order to provide integrated services to additional adults. Each project shall include outreach and service grants in accordance with a contract between the state and approved counties that reflects the number of anticipated contacts with people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and the number of those who are severely mentally ill and who are likely to be successfully referred for treatment and will remain in treatment as necessary. All counties that receive funding shall be subject to specific terms and conditions of oversight and training which shall be developed by the department, in consultation with the advisory committee. As used in this part, ""receiving extensive mental health services"" means having a personal services coordinator, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 5806, and having an individual personal service plan, as described in subdivision (c) of Section 5806. The funding provided pursuant to this part shall be sufficient to provide mental health services, medically necessary medications to treat severe mental illnesses, alcohol and drug services, transportation, supportive housing and other housing assistance, vocational rehabilitation and supported employment services, money management assistance for accessing other health care and obtaining federal income and housing support, accessing veterans' services, stipends, and other incentives to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified professionals as necessary to provide the necessary levels of these services. These grants shall, however, pay for only that portion of the costs of those services not otherwise provided by federal funds or other state funds. Methods used by counties to contract for services pursuant to paragraph (2) shall promote prompt and flexible use of funds, consistent with the scope of services for which the county has contracted with each provider. Contracts awarded pursuant to this part shall be exempt from the Public Contract Code and the state administrative manual and shall not be subject to the approval of the Department of General Services. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds awarded to counties pursuant to this part and Part 4 (commencing with Section 5850) shall not require a local match in funds. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
