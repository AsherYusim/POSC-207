Digest                            LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST AB 2234, as introduced, Bonnie Lowenthal. Mental health: target populations: older adults. Existing law, the Bronzan-McCorquodale Act, contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs. Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, establishes the Mental Health Services Fund to fund various county mental health programs. The act may be amended by the Legislature only by a 2/3 vote of both houses and only so long as the amendment is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act. The Legislature may clarify procedures and terms of the act by majority vote. Existing law, the Adult and Older Adult Mental Health System of Care Act, sets out a system of mental health care services, provided by participating counties pursuant to Proposition 63, for adults and older adults with serious mental disorders. Existing law defines serious mental disorders and includes a definition of functional impairment for that purpose. This bill would make the current definition of functional impairment applicable to adults 18 to 59 years of age, inclusive, and would, in addition, establish a definition of functional impairment for adults 60 years of age or older. The bill would also make eligible for services pursuant to this program adults 60 years of age or older who require brief treatment as a result of a natural disaster or severe local emergency. By expanding eligibility for community mental health services, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. Vote: 2/3. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: yes.
