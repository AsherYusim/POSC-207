Digest                            LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST SB 1140, as amended, Yee. Voter registration  : ONE-STOP VOTING  . Existing law establishes procedures regarding the registration of voters. Under existing law, a person may not be registered to vote except by affidavit of registration, and a voter may not vote in an election unless his or her affidavit of registration is executed and received by the county elections official on or before the 15th day prior to the election. Existing law permits any registered voter to vote by a vote by mail ballot, and further permits any voter using a vote by mail ballot to vote the ballot at the office of the elections official beginning 29 days before the election. This bill would establish one-stop voting where a person would be permitted to register to vote and immediately vote on election day or at any time prior to election day when ballots may be cast. The bill would require a voter, in order to register and vote by means of one-stop voting, to visit a location at which one-stop voting is available, to present proof of identity and current residence, as specified, and to complete an affidavit of registration. Upon completing that registration, the voter would be immediately eligible to vote by regular ballot. If the voter is unable to complete that registration because the voter is unable to present proof of identity or proof of current residence, the voter would be permitted to register and vote by  a vote by mail   PROVISIONAL  ballot. The bill would require each county elections official to compile an index of voters who register to vote by one-stop voting. After the official canvass of the votes for that election is completed, the elections official would be required to review the names on the index and cancel duplicate registrations. The elections official would be required to send a voter registration form to every person who properly registered to vote by one-stop voting, and those persons would be registered for future elections  AT THE ADDRESS THAT THE VOTER DECLARED FOR PURPOSES OF VOTER REGISTRATION  . The elections official would be required to notify the district attorney and the Secretary of State if it appears that a person has engaged in fraudulent voting. The bill would require that one-stop voting be available at every permanent office of a county elections official beginning in 2011  , at every location in each county at which early voting is available beginning in 2012, and at every polling place at which VoteCal, as defined, is available, provided that there is   . COMMENCING IN 2013, IF VOTECAL, AS DEFINED, IS APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR USE AT POLLING PLACES , EACH COUNTY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLIS H  at least one location for every 100,000 electors,  beginning in 2013   OR ENSURE THAT EVERY VOTER RESIDENCE IS WITHIN 10 MILES OF SUCH A SITE  . In addition, the bill would require that each location at which one-stop voting is available have a separate area for the process and have at least one precinct board member who is trained in one-stop voting. The bill would further require the Secretary of State and local elections officials to make efforts to educate voters about one-stop voting. The bill would authorize the Secretary of State to adopt appropriate regulations to implement one-stop registration and voting. By creating new duties for local elections officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions. Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: yes. Text THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: It is a fundamental principle of the United States that the people shall have access to our systems of democracy without barriers to their participation. California currently ranks 41st out of 50 states in voter turnout. AT THE NOVEMBER 4, 2008, STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION, CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED ITS LARGEST VOTER TURNOUT, AS WELL AS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PERSONS--798,332--WHO CAST PROVISIONAL BALLOTS BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR REGISTRATION STATUS. WHILE 82 PERCENT OF THOSE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS WERE ULTIMATELY COUNTED, THE COUNTY INVESTMENT OF STAFF OVERTIME AND RESOURCES TO PROCESS THESE BALLOTS WAS ENORMOUS. AT THE SAME TIME, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT WERE NOT COUNTED RESULTED FROM THE FAILURE TO TIMELY REGISTER. ONE-STOP REGISTRATION AND VOTING WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THE STAFF OVERTIME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSING NUMEROUS PROVISIONAL BALLOTS FOR COUNTIES.   (c)  One-stop voting, without unnecessary steps, can significantly increase turnout. The nine states that have enacted one-stop voting lead the nation in voter turnout.  (d)  The more people who vote, the more clearly the public's voice is heard.  (e)  California's registration procedures have not kept up with available technology to maximize the efficiency of the voting process.  (f)  It is vital that California make every effort to maintain the integrity of our democracy by ensuring that every eligible voter may vote on election day. Section 2107 of the Elections Code is amended to read: Except as provided in subdivision (b) and Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 2170), the county elections official shall accept affidavits of registration at all times except during the 14 days immediately preceding any election, when registration shall cease for that election as to electors residing in the territory within which the election is to be held. Transfers of registration for an election may be made from one precinct to another precinct  IN THE SAME COUNTY  at any time when registration is in progress in the precinct to which the elector seeks to transfer. The county elections official shall accept an affidavit of registration executed as part of a voter registration card in the forthcoming election if the affidavit is executed on or before the 15th day prior to the election, and if any of the following apply: The affidavit is postmarked on or before the 15th day prior to the election and received by mail by the county elections official. The affidavit is submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles or accepted by any other public agency designated as a voter registration agency pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973gg) prior to the election. The affidavit is delivered to the county elections official by means other than those described in paragraphs (1) and (2) on or before the 15th day prior to the election. Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 2170) is added to Chapter 2 of Division 2 of the Elections Code, to read: Registration and Voting at One-Stop Voting Sites For purposes of this article, ""VoteCal"" means the statewide voter registration database established by the Secretary of State and referred to by that designation.
