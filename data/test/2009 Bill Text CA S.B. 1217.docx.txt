Digest                            LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST SB 1217, as introduced, Committee on Public Employment and Retirement. State government: warrants: employee designees. Existing law authorizes an employee of the state to designate a person who, upon the death of the employee, is entitled to receive all warrants that would have been payable to the deceased employee had that employee survived. This bill would repeal and recast this provision to additionally authorize an employee of the state to designate a primary person and up to 3 contingent persons for receipt of employee warrants upon death. This bill would require, if the first-designated person predeceases the employee, that the next-designated contingent person who survives the employee receive these warrants. This bill would specify that a corporation, a trust, or an estate may be a designated ""person,"" entitled to receive these warrants pursuant to this provision. Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: no. Text THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: Section 12479 of the Government Code is repealed. 12479.
