The Department of Health will develop the funding criteria processes, which include assessing statewide benefits, sustainability, access to primary care improvements, ER diversion potential, and health care innovations that are replicable and with a three-year limit on low-income pool funding. The total low-income pool payments provided in this proviso are contingent on the state share being provided through grants and donations from state, county or other governmental funds. From the funds in Specific Appropriation 190, $ 970,800 from the Grants and Donations Trust Fund and $ 2,029,200 from the Medical Care Trust Fund are provided to make Medicaid low-income pool payments to hospitals.

From the funds in Specific Appropriation 190, $ 39,989,570 in non-recurring grants and donations trust funds and $ 83,587,593 in non-recurring medical care trust funds are provided to make Medicaid low-income payments to hospital provider access systems. The funding shall be distributed in a two-step allocation process. The first phase of the allocation process shall distribute payments to qualified hospitals based on the amount of local government funding provided for the uninsured and underinsured. Payments to qualified hospitals will be capped at 100.0 percent of the amount of local government funding it would have received for the uninsured and underinsured without the Low Income Pool program. The local funds for this section of proviso are separate from any other Low Income Pool or hospital program and the amount of local government funding for the first phase of the allocation process shall be limited to $ 39,989,570. The second phase of the allocation process is to distribute the remaining funds based on a hospital's Medicaid days, charity care days, and 50 percent of bad debt days to the total Medicaid days, charity care days and 50 percent of bad debt days of all qualifying hospitals. To receive funds in this distribution, the hospital's Medicaid days, charity care days, and 50 percent of bad debt days divided by the hospital's total days must equal or exceed 10 percent. Rural hospitals shall be excluded from the second phase of the allocation process.  All hospitals with accepted 2006 Financial Hospital Uniform Reporting System (FHURS) data are eligible for the second phase of the allocation process. The distribution of funds under this section of proviso are contingent on the Agency for Health Care Administration obtaining an amendment to the Special Terms and Conditions for the Florida Medicaid Reform section 1115 demonstration that allows for the distribution of $ 1 billion under the Low Income Pool program in the fifth year of the demonstration. If the amendment to the demonstration is not approved by January 31, 2010, then the funds in this section of proviso shall be used in Fiscal Year 2010-2011 for the Low Income Pool program as appropriated in the Fiscal Year 2010-2011 General Appropriations Act. The agency may make low-income pool Medicaid payments to hospitals in an accelerated manner that is more frequent than on a quarterly basis, subject to the availability of state, local and federal funds. The agency is authorized to transfer a hospital's low-income pool payments between the various low-income programs listed in this specific appropriation if it is required to obtain approval of the low-income pool payment methodology from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Any transfer of funds, however, is contingent on the hospital's net low-income pool payments under the low-income pool plan remaining unchanged. In the event that the amount of approved non-federal share of matching funds is not provided by local governmental entities, the agency may re-allocate low-income pool funds between programs described within this specific appropriation as necessary to ensure sufficient non-federal matching funds. No re-allocation, under this provision, of low-income pool funds may occur if the level of program increase for any provider access system exceeds the amount of the additional increases in the local non-federal share match that their local governments transfer to the state Medicaid program, and for which the provider access system would have otherwise received. Funds provided in Specific Appropriation 190 are contingent upon the non-federal share being provided through grants and donations from state, county or other governmental funds. In the event the non-federal share provided through grants and donations is not available to fund the Medicaid low-income payments for eligible Medicaid providers, known as provider access systems, the agency shall submit a revised low-income pool plan to the Legislative Budget Commission for approval. Distribution of such funds provided in Specific Appropriation 190 are contingent upon approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.

CORRECTIONS, DEPARTMENT OF From the funds in Specific Appropriations 582 through 773, each provider contracting with the Department of Corrections must provide the department with a proposal prior to the release of funds that details the services that will be delivered, the expected results, and recommended performance measures. The department and each provider must execute a contract before the release of any funds, and the contract documents must include mutually agreed upon performance measures. Each provider must provide quarterly performance reports to the department. Funds shall only be released to providers whose performance reports indicate successful compliance with the performance measures described in the contract. The Department of Corrections shall develop and use a uniform format and uniform methodologies for the purpose of reporting annually to the Governor and to the Legislature on the state prison system. Such reports shall include a comprehensive plan for current facility use and any departures from planned facility use, including opening new facilities, renovating or closing existing facilities, and advancing or delaying the opening of new or renovated facilities. The report shall include the maximum capacity of currently operating facilities and the potential maximum capacity of facilities that the department could make operational within the fiscal year.  The report shall also identify appropriate sites for future facilities and provide information to support specified locations, such as availability of personnel in local labor markets. Reports should include updated infrastructure needs for existing or future facilities. Each report should reconcile capacity figures to the immediately preceding report. For the purpose of this paragraph, maximum capacity shall be calculated and displayed pursuant to section 944.023(1)(b), Florida Statutes. The department may provide additional analysis of current and future bed needs based on such factors as deemed necessary by the Secretary. The next report shall be due January 1, 2010. Funds in Specific Appropriations 582 through 773 shall not be used to pay for unoccupied space currently being leased by the Department of Corrections in the event the leases are vacant on or after July 1, 2009, and for which it has been determined by the Secretary of the department that there is no longer a need. The Department of Corrections may, subject to all applicable provisions of chapter 216, Florida Statutes, transfer funds and positions and salary rate among budget entities and programs within Specific Appropriations 582 through 773 if necessary, to ensure public safety and avoid adversely affecting current employees due to the elimination of vacant positions and other approved reductions. It is the intent of the Legislature that priority shall be placed on preserving positions in correctional institutions and community corrections. Funds in Specific Appropriations 582 through 773 include reductions in full-time equivalent positions and associated salary and benefits. Those reductions in full-time equivalent positions must be from, to the maximum extent feasible, supervisory and managerial positions. To minimize the impact of funding reductions within Specific Appropriations 582 through 773, the department shall identify vacant correctional work release and substance abuse programming capacity and has the discretion pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 216, Florida Statutes, to transfer funds to enable the filling of such additional capacity in accordance with the provisions of chapter 945, Florida Statutes. By February 1, 2010, the department shall provide the Legislature a report on the department's provision of food services to inmates housed in Florida's state prisons. The report shall include data from the period January 2009 through January 2010. The report shall include but not be limited to the master menu provided for the inmate population, caloric content of meals, inmate participation rate at meals, department staffing structure, detailed analysis of total expenditures, per diem cost, federal grant participation, utilization of certified minority business enterprises and utilization of PRIDE.

Funding is provided as follows: $ 269,324 for the Bay Correctional Facility, $ 339,242 for the Moore Haven Correctional Facility, $ 275,560 for the South Bay Correctional Facility, $ 100,000 for the Gadsden Correctional Facility and $ 90,236 for the Lake City Correctional Facility. These funds may not be distributed if there are outstanding claims for ad valorem taxes due on the property at issue and may not be distributed until the property is reclassified on the real property and tangible personal property rolls as Government State property back to the date the finance corporation or other state entity acquired the title thereto. These distributions shall be adjusted, with the respect to any facility, to reimburse the Department of Management Services, and any predecessor agency, for the total amounts expended by the state in resisting the imposition of such ad valorem tax claims, including all attorneys' fees and costs actually incurred by the state's agencies. From the funds in Specific Appropriations 617, 631, and 644, the Department of Management Services must ensure all future private prison contracts have explicit conditions that provide for the flexibility to adjust the percentages of special needs inmates to allow for changes in overall state populations of those inmates. Such percentages must be based on Department of Corrections' special needs inmate population forecasts, so that medical and mental healthcare costs are appropriately shared by both private and state prisons. All future private prison contracts must require each private prison vendor to report the same performance measures for inmate programs in private prisons as reported by the Department of Corrections for its comparable public institutions.  As part of the private prisons contracting negotiations process, the Department of Corrections must consult with the Department of Management Services and each private prison vendor to establish high, reasonable, and achievable performance standards. All future private prison contracts must require each private prison vendor to develop inmate visitation policies and telephone rates for the private prisons that are consistent with those policies followed by the state's public prisons and encourage inmate family contact, as directed by Florida Statutes.  Finally, the Department of Management Services must require all future private prison contracts to adhere to Department of Management Services' established criteria for awarding Privately Operated Institutions Inmate Welfare Trust Fund monies so that Department of Management Services' staff can verify such funds are being used appropriately. If at any time during the term of the contract, including any renewal period, the Legislature reduces appropriations to the department or the department's legally available funds are otherwise inadequate to fully fund the contract, the parties agree to collaborate in good faith in accommodating such funding shortfalls in a manner least disruptive to current operations. If necessary, the parties agree to engage in good faith negotiations to amend the contract to achieve commensurate reduction in services corresponding to any proposed or necessary per diem reduction. If accommodations or negotiations become irreconcilably untenable to the parties, the Department of Management Services may exercise its no-fault termination rights under the contract. From the funds in Specific Appropriations 617, 631, and 644, the Department of Management Services is directed to execute private prison contract amendments to each operations and management contract for each correctional facility currently under its supervision in order to provide the contractors the maximum flexibility to address recurring reductions in contract amounts. Such contract amendments shall expire on June 30, 2010. The Department of Management Services and the private prison contractors may amend the provisions of the private prison operating contracts limiting correctional officer overtime and part-time hours to be consistent with the overtime and part-time use as permitted by the Department of Corrections and the American Correctional Association standards. The contract amendments may also eliminate deductions for vacant positions as long as the services associated with the position are being provided through the use of overtime or part-time staff. The Department of Management Services may amend the private prison operating contracts to provide for the payment of costs associated with all inmate academic, vocational, behavioral and substance abuse programs from funds in the Privately Operated Institutions Inmate Welfare Trust Fund. Such contract amendments may not negatively affect the Department of Corrections. The Department of Corrections may contract through a request for proposal for innovative and cost effective approaches to the financing, construction and operation of private correctional beds and services which can include any and all operations defined and requested by the department, including but not limited to financing, operations, housing, staffing, security, meals, medical care, transportation, education and substance abuse treatment services. The department may consult with other state agencies on the development of this request for proposal.  Any resulting contract shall be funded through existing appropriations, and at a minimum provide for per diem costs at a cost of at least seven percent below what the department can incarcerate similar inmates. The department shall not implement this section in a manner that reduces participation in existing reentry programs. ADULT MALE CUSTODY OPERATIONS Funds and positions in Specific Appropriations 607 through 773, include: an increase of 36 full-time equivalent positions and $ 772,852 from the General Revenue Fund to support the state-wide inmate population increase. These funds and positions are sufficient to provide housing and security for 105,583 inmates when fully annualized. Variable expenses, maintenance, and health services funds are provided for an average daily population of 103,270 inmates.

Allow the SSRC to contract with another state agency for use of its electronic mail system with similar electronic mail services to temporarily provide electronic mail services for existing customers. 2.  Allow the SSRC to procure an externally sourced system option that can be used to provide temporary electronic mail services for the existing customers. 3.

The ability of each option to meet major requirements of each customer; 2.  A description of the scope of functionality and operations; and 3.  A description of the required resources associated with each option, including one-time acquisition costs, mail migration costs, and ongoing operations, administrative overhead, and staffing costs. If the option results in increased electronic mail costs for any customer, the proposal shall identify those costs and the funding sources proposed to pay those costs. In order to develop the proposal, the Agency for Enterprise Information Technology shall consult with and, as necessary, form workgroups consisting of agency staff from affected state agencies.
