Section 53: Flex Notwithstanding any other statement of purpose, the purpose of each appropriation of federal funds or other funds shall be the stated purpose or any other lawful purpose consistent with the fund source and the general law powers of the budget unit. In the preceding sentence, ""Federal Funds"" means any federal funding source, whether specifically identified or not specifically identified; ""Other Funds"" means all other fund sources except State Funds or Federal Funds, including without limitation, Intra-State Government Transfers. This paragraph does not permit an agency to include within its flex the appropriations for an agency attached to it for administrative purposes. Section 54: Budgetary Control and Interpretation The appropriations of State Funds in this Act consist of the amount stated, for each line at the lowest level of detail, associated with the statement of Program Name and Program Purpose. The appropriations of Federal Funds and of Other Funds in this Act consist of the amount stated at the highest or summary level of detail associated with the statement of Program Name and Program Purpose, and the lower levels of detail are for information only. In the preceding sentence, ""Federal Funds"" means any federal funding source, whether specifically identified or not specifically identified; ""Other Funds"" means all other fund sources except State Funds and Federal Funds, including in Other Funds without limitation all Intra-State Government Transfers.

Program Names appear as underlined captions, and Program Purpose appears immediately below as italicized text. Text within a box is not an appropriation and is for information only. The lowest level of detail for local assistance grants in Section 15 and the lowest level of detail for authorizations for general obligation debt in Section 49 are the authorizing paragraphs. Effective Date This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without his approval.
