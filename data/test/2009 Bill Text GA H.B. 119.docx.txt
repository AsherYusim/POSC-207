The direct bill rates paid by state agencies in the direct bill system shall be set based on an equivalent amount of employer revenue appropriated on behalf of active and retired state employees in HB 210. The direct bill rates paid by local boards of education in the direct bill system shall be set based on an equivalent amount of employer revenue appropriated on behalf of active and retired teachers and school employees in HB 210, effective January 1, 2010.  The employer contribution rate for the teachers' health benefit plan for Fiscal Year 2010 is calculated based on 18.534% and for the state employees' health benefit plan for Fiscal Year 2010 is calculated based on 22.165%. Whereas, the Department of Community Health is the sole Administrator of the State Health Benefit Plan for purposes of collecting COBRA premiums and providing medical continuation coverage pursuant to federal COBRA law; and whereas, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 COBRA Premium Reduction rules require the Department of Community Health to provide COBRA coverage to certain ""Assistance Eligible Individuals"" upon receiving only 35% of COBRA premium payment from such individuals; therefore, the remaining 65% of the SHBP COBRA premium is to be recouped exclusively by DCH as the sole COBRA Administrator of SHBP through adjustments to DCH payroll taxes.

Section 52:  Leases In accordance with the requirements of Article IX, Section VI, Paragraph Ia of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, as amended, there is hereby appropriated payable to each department, agency, or institution of the State sums sufficient to satisfy the payments required to be made in each year, under existing lease contracts between any department, agency, or institution of the State, and any authority created and activated at the time of the effective date of the aforesaid constitutional provision, as amended, or appropriated for the State fiscal year addressed within this Act. If for any reason any of the sums herein provided under any other provision of this Act are insufficient to make the required payments in full, there shall be taken from other funds appropriated to the department, agency or institution involved, an amount sufficient to satisfy such deficiency in full and the lease payment constitutes a first charge on all such appropriations. Section 53:  Flex Notwithstanding any other statement of purpose, the purpose of each appropriation of federal funds or other funds shall be the stated purpose, unless such purpose conflicts with state or federal law. If the stated purpose conflicts with state or federal law, then the purpose statement shall be construed as any other lawful purpose consistent with the fund source and the general law powers of the budget unit. When an agency receives appropriations from the category, ""Total Federal Funds,"" for more than one program or special project, the appropriation is the amount stated, and each program or special project shall also be authorized an additional fifty percent (50%) of the stated amount. However, if the additional authority is used, one or more of the other federal fund appropriations to that agency are reduced in the same total amount, such that the cumulative total in affected appropriations initially stated within the section is not exceeded, except that when an agency receives an appropriation from the category ""Total Federal Funds"" and such funds are identified ""Temporary Assistance for Needy Families"" (TANF), the appropriation is the amount stated and the agency may not reduce such funds below the amount stated. Where federal funds received by an agency or other funds received by an agency and not remitted to the general fund of the state treasury are not otherwise restricted by state or federal law, the agency shall use such funds to supplant appropriated state funds in the following order: first, other funds received by the agency, and second, federal funds. ""Federal Funds"" means any federal funding source, whether specifically identified or not specifically identified; ""Other Funds"" means all other fund sources except State Funds or Federal Funds, including without limitation, Intra-State Government Transfers. This section does not permit an agency to include within its flex the appropriations for an agency attached to it for administrative purposes. Section 54:  Budgetary Control and Interpretation The appropriations in this Act consist of the amount stated in the right-most column, for each line at the lowest level of detail for the fund source categories, ""Total State Funds"" and ""Total Federal Funds,"" under a caption beginning with a program or special project number that has a 100 or a higher number after the decimal and a program or special project name. In each case, such appropriation is associated with the immediately preceding program or special project name, number, and statement of program or special project purpose. The program or special project purpose is stated immediately below the program or special project name. For authorizations for general obligation debt in Section 49, the indented, bold-faced paragraphs following each Bond number are the lowest level of detail and constitute appropriations in accordance with Article VII, Section IV, Paragraph III(a)(1) of the Georgia Constitution. The caption above the Bond number, the light-faced text immediately following the Bond number before the bold-faced text, and the lightfaced after the bold-faced text are information only. Similarly, text in a group of lines that has a number less than 100 after the decimal (01 through 99) is not part of a statement of purpose but constitutes information as to how the appropriation was derived. Amounts in the columns other than the right-most column are for informational purposes only. The summary and lowest level of detail for the fund source categories ""Total Agency Funds"" and ""Total Intra-State Governmental Transfers,"" are for informational purposes only. The blocks of text and numerals immediately following the section header and beginning with the phrases, ""Section Total - Continuation"" and ""Section Totals - Final"" are for informational purposes only. Sections 50, 51, 52, and 53 contain, constitute, or amend appropriations. Section 55:  Effective Date This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without his approval. Section 56:  Repeal Conflicting Laws All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are repealed.
