Digest                                    EXPLANATION This bill requires that all voters show current and valid identification before being allowed to vote at the polls. Correspondingly, the bill strikes the requirement that certain persons who register by mail and who have not previously voted in a federal election in the county of registration must show identification when voting for the first time in the county at an election with federal offices on the ballot. The bill further provides that the current and valid identification is the same forms of identification required for election day and in-person absentee registrants if such identification contains a photograph of the voter and the validity expiration date of the identification. The bill also specifies that the requirement in current law that a voter show identification if the voter's name does not appear on the election register or if the voter did not respond to a confirmation card sent by the county commissioner of elections is required in order to establish residency in the precinct. Current law provides that the secretary of state shall provide, by rule, the acceptable forms of identification in these circumstances.
