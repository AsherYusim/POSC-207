Digest                                    EXPLANATION This bill concerns state government, and provides for reorganizing government agencies, eliminating boards and commissions, providing for governmental efficiencies, and including other matters related to the operation of state government. DIGITAL GOVERNMENT. DIVISION I -- GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES. Division I concerns information technology services. The division also modifies provisions relative to information technology services provided by the department of administrative services. Code section 8A.111(3) is amended by striking the requirement of the department to provide an annual report regarding total spending on technology currently required to be prepared by the technology governance board. This division of the bill eliminates the board, replaces it with an advisory council, and eliminates the requirement to prepare this annual report. Code section 8A.122, concerning the exemption granted the state board of regents from obtaining services from the department of administrative services without their consent, is amended to eliminate this exemption as it relates to information technology services. Code section 8A.201 is amended to add a definition for infrastructure services as it relates to information technology. The bill defines infrastructure services to include data centers, servers and mainframes, wide area and local area networks, cybersecurity functions, and disaster recovery technology. Code section 8A.201(4) is amended to provide that all state agencies are considered participating agencies for purposes of information technology services provided by the department of administrative services. Current law excludes the state board of regents, public broadcasting, the state department of transportation mobile radio network, the department of public safety law enforcement communications systems, the telecommunications and technology commission with respect to information technology that is unique to the Iowa communications network, the Iowa lottery authority, a judicial district department of correctional services, and the Iowa finance authority from the definition of a participating agency. New Code section 8A.201A provides for the appointment of the chief information officer (CIO). The new Code section provides that the CIO shall be appointed by the governor, and shall have at least five years of experience in the fields of information technology and financial management. Code section 8A.104(12), which provides that the director of the department of administrative services shall serve as the CIO or shall designate one, is stricken. Code section 8A.202, concerning the mission, powers, and duties of the department as it relates to information technology, is amended to provide a process by which agencies may seek a waiver for any of the requirements concerning the acquisition of information technology. Generally, a waiver can be granted if the requesting agency can obtain or provide the technology more economically or a waiver would be in the best interests of the state. Code section 8A.203, concerning the powers and duties of the director of the department as it relates to information technology, is amended to provide that these powers and duties are granted to the CIO in consultation with the director. The section is also amended to add duties for the CIO relative to operating the information technology aspects of the department, rulemaking, and entering into contracts. Code section 8A.204, establishing the technology governance board, is amended to provide for a technology advisory council. The bill establishes the membership of the council and provides that the council's primary role is to advise the CIO and the department concerning information technology services. Code section 8A.205, concerning digital government, is amended to provide that the department shall assist agencies in converting printed government materials to electronic materials which can be accessed through an internet searchable database. Code section 8A.207, concerning the procurement of information technology, is amended to provide that the department shall be the sole provider of infrastructure services to state agencies and shall develop policies and procedures that apply to all information technology acquisitions by state agencies. Code section 8A.221, establishing the IowAccess advisory council, is rewritten by the bill. The bill eliminates the advisory council and provides that the department shall establish IowAccess and shall have the powers relative to IowAccess previously granted the IowAccess advisory council relative to setting rates and approving projects. Code section 8A.223, providing for an annual technology audit of the electronic transmission system by which government records are transmitted electronically to the public, is repealed and the requirement in Code section 8A.111 to submit an annual report concerning the audit is stricken. The division directs the department of administrative services to consult with and explore opportunities with the legislative and judicial branches of government relative to the providing of information technology services to those branches of government. This division of the bill also requires the chief information officer of the state to conduct a study regarding convenience fees charged by state agencies by credit or debit card or other electronic means of payment. The study shall determine the fees charged and the revenue generated by the fees, and shall explore ways to reduce or eliminate these fees. The division of the bill also directs state agencies to utilize electronic mail to notify holders of permits and licenses that the license or permit needs to be renewed. DIVISION II -- ELECTRONIC RECORDS. Code section 7A.11A, concerning reports to the general assembly, is amended to eliminate the requirement that a printed copy of all reports be filed with the general assembly. The requirement to file reports electronically remains. The division of the bill provides that the departments of administrative services and cultural affairs, in consultation with the state records commission, shall conduct a study on and make recommendations for the creation, storage, and retention of state agency records in an electronic format and shall submit a report containing the recommendations to the general assembly by December 15, 2010. In conducting the study, the departments shall collect and assess information from each state agency that includes an inventory of each agency's records including the types of agency records as well as agency records series retention and disposition schedules. The assessment shall include agency records identified as having permanent historical value by the state records commission. The departments shall also describe in the report what efficiencies and cost-saving efforts could be achieved through the creation, storage, and maintenance of such records in an electronic format. DIVISION III -- PUBLICATION MODERNIZATION. The bill amends a number of provisions which allow the legislative council and the legislative services agency to control information used to publish official legal publications (the Iowa Acts, the Iowa Code, the Iowa administrative bulletins, the Iowa administrative code, and the Iowa court rules). The bill provides for their publication and official designation, including production and distribution in an electronic or printed form, and for their official publication date for editing and revision changes. The bill provides procedures for payment by persons receiving or purchasing legislative services agency publications and authorizes the creation of a publications revolving fund. The bill provides for the publication of the entire Iowa Code each year or the Iowa Code and the Code Supplement in alternating years. It updates provisions to conform with current practice including detailing the contents of the publications. It accounts for computer programming necessary to distribute publications in an electronic format, and provides for citing and authenticating provisions in those publications in order to conform to current practice and to better accommodate electronic publication. The bill amends provisions requiring state agencies to deposit copies of state publications with the department of education's division of libraries and information services, by requiring that the publications be provided in an electronic format. DIVISION IV -- ELECTRONIC PUBLICATION OF PUBLIC NOTICES. Division IV of the bill relates to the publication of notices, actions, and other information by governmental bodies, as defined in the division. Under the division, a governmental body that is required by statute to publish, or post in a public place, a notice, action, or other information, may, in lieu of such requirements, post the notice, action, or other information on an internet site if posting such information on an internet site has been authorized, by ordinance, resolution, or other official action of the governmental body and the type of notice, action, or other information required to be posted is identified in the ordinance, resolution, or other official action. The governmental body must also identify a location where such notice, action, or information will be available for public inspection. The division does not allow notices under Code chapter 6B (""Procedure Under Eminent Domain""), notices under Code chapter 17A, notices provided under the rules of civil procedure, or any notice required to be given by personal service to be posted on an internet site in lieu of publication or service. The division requires notices, actions, or other information posted on an internet site to include all information otherwise required to be published and requires compliance with all provisions relating to the date of publication. The division also requires an internet site used to post notices, actions, and other information to be operated and maintained by the governmental body; accessible at all times by the public, including the visually impaired; accessible to the public without charge; and searchable. All information posted on an internet site under the division shall be maintained and accessible through the same internet site address for as long as required by law or as long as such information is customarily maintained by the governmental body, whichever is longer. The division requires a governmental body to make all information posted on the internet site, in lieu of publication or posting in a public place, available in a paper format in the governmental body's office. STATE BUDGETING AND PERSONNEL PRACTICES. DIVISION V -- STATE BUDGETING AND PERSONNEL. Code section 8.36A, concerning full-time equivalent (FTE) positions, is amended to provide that state agencies shall not convert FTE positions into contract positions and that state agencies shall have their FTE position authorization reduced if a position remains unfilled and vacant for six months. The bill provides that the state agency can request the director of the department of management to allow the conversion of an FTE to a contract position if the conversion will provide comparable or increased services at reduced cost or to permit the agency to retain a vacant FTE position if the position is hard to fill and critical to the agency. Code section 8.62, concerning the use of retained reversion money for employee training, is amended to provide that an agency can use such reversion money for internet-based training. Current law does not specify that the training be internet-based. Code section 8A.413 is amended to require the department of administrative services to adopt merit system rules for the development and operation of programs within the executive branch to promote job sharing, telecommuting, and flex-time employment opportunities. This division of the bill also requires each judicial district department of correctional services to utilize the state accounting system for tracking both appropriations and expenditures, requires state agencies to budget and plan for lean events, and encourages state agencies to share resources and services. This division also addresses state budgeting practices for FY 2010-2011. Each executive branch agency is required to separately track the budget and actual expenditures for contract services and for employee training. The terms of the contracts entered into or revised during the fiscal year are required to incorporate quality assurance and cost control measures. The training tracking is also required to be further detailed to reflect training categories and the report to address the use of electronically based training. This division of the bill also directs each joint appropriations subcommittee of the general assembly to conduct a review of fees charged by agencies within the purview of that budget subcommittee. DIVISION VI -- SPAN OF CONTROL. This division revises provisions contained in the 2009 Iowa Acts revising state human resource management requirements under the department of administrative services in Code section 8A.402 for the span of control of supervisory employees in the executive branch. The term ""supervisory employee"" is defined to mean a public employee who has authority, in the interest of a public employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other public employees, the responsibility to direct such employees, or to adjust the grievances of such employees, or to effectively recommend any listed action. A supervisory employee is not a member of a collective bargaining unit. If a supervisory employee is being laid off as part of expanding the number of employees in the ratio of supervisory employees to other employees, the supervisory employee does not have the right to replace or bump a junior employee not being laid off for a position for which the supervisory employee is qualified. Current law provides for an executive branch policy to have an aggregate ratio in the number of employees per supervisory employee of 14 to one by the target date of July 1, 2011. The bill instead provides for a ratio of 15 to one by fiscal year 2011-2012, with an annual incremental increase in the ratio by one until the ratio becomes 20 to one by fiscal year 2016-2017. Current law allows a small agency with not more than 28 full-time equivalent employees to apply for an exception. The bill allows an additional exception when the supervisory employee ratio is subject to a federal requirement. The bill also provides that if layoffs are implemented, the number of middle management position layoffs are to correspond to the relative number of direct service position layoffs. The state system is required to improve by specifically defining and accounting for supervisory employees span of control. Reporting requirements are extended to cover the multiyear period addressed by the bill. The exemption from the span of control requirements for the state board of regents, department of human services, and judicial district department of correctional services is removed. The division takes effect upon enactment. ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATION. DIVISION VII -- DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES -- PURCHASING. Division VII of the bill concerns purchasing items through and by the department of administrative services. Code section 8A.302(1), concerning the purchase of items of general use, is amended to eliminate the general exemption from the requirement to purchase these items from the department of administrative services for the department of transportation, institutions under the control of the state board of regents, the department for the blind, and any other agencies otherwise exempted. The bill does authorize the department to allow these agencies to purchase these items without utilizing the department of administrative services if in the best interests of the state. A corresponding change is made to Code section 307.21 to provide that the department of transportation may utilize centralized purchasing for itself only if the department of administrative services so authorizes. Code section 8A.311(10), concerning the authority of agencies to obtain services directly from a vendor, is amended to require the agency to obtain approval from the department to purchase directly from a vendor. In addition, the bill requires that a waiver may be granted if purchasing from a vendor is more economical, and not just as economical. New Code section 8A.311A provides authority to the department of administrative services to require agencies to purchase goods or services of general use as designated by the department pursuant to a master contract negotiated by the department. The new Code section also gives governmental subdivisions the option to purchase goods and services pursuant to the contract. The new Code section provides that the department shall negotiate master contracts for a particular service if the department determines that a high-quality good or service can be acquired by agencies and governmental subdivisions at lower cost through negotiation of a master contract. The bill provides that an agency can directly purchase the item from a vendor if the department determines that the agency satisfies the requirements for a direct purchase otherwise provided in Code section 8A.311(10) or is acquired pursuant to an existing service contract. This division of the bill also directs the department of administrative services to require agencies to provide the department of administrative services with reports about what agencies plan to buy on an annual basis, require agencies to report on an annual basis about efforts to standardize products and services within their own agencies and with other state agencies, require all employees who conduct bids for services to receive training on an annual basis about procurement rules and regulations and procurement best practices, identify procurement compliance employees within the department of administrative services, review the process and basis for establishing department of administrative services fees for purchasing, establish a work group to collaborate on best practices to implement the best cost savings for the state, explore interstate and intergovernmental purchasing opportunities and encourage the legislative and judicial branches to participate in consolidated purchasing and efficiencies wherever possible, and to expand the use of procurement cards. DIVISION VIII -- DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES -- OPERATIONS. Division VIII of this bill concerns operations of the department of administrative services. Code section 8A.104, concerning the duties of the director of the department, is amended to provide that a duty of the director is to examine and develop best practices for the efficient operation of government and to encourage state agencies to adopt and implement these practices. New Code section 8A.459 provides that all state employees, by July 1, 2011, shall receive their pay and allowances through electronic funds transfer. The new Code section allows state employees to receive their pay and allowances through a paper warrant but only after paying the department an administrative fee for processing such paper warrants. The bill does allow the department to grant a waiver from paying the administrative fee. This division of the bill also requires the department of administrative services to study ways to streamline the hiring process for personnel within state agencies. The division also requires the department to conduct an audit of real estate and leases of state government, study the possibility of selling and leasing back government properties, and to submit a report to the general assembly by January 1, 2011, concerning these audits and studies. DIVISION IX -- ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DIVISION -- REORGANIZATION. This division of this bill transfers the alcoholic beverages division from the department of commerce to the department of revenue. DIVISION X -- ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DIVISION -- OPERATIONS. This division concerns certain operations of the alcoholic beverages division. This division of the bill requires the administrator of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to close the main state warehouse keeping alcoholic liquors every Friday for FY 2010-2011 with the authority to extend this closure requirement for an additional fiscal year. The bill authorizes the administrator to keep the warehouse open on designated Fridays if anticipated sales on that Friday justify keeping the warehouse open. This division also restricts the number of checks conducted to ensure licensed retail establishment compliance with tobacco laws, regulations, and ordinances applicable to minors to one such check for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, and ending June 30, 2011. The compliance checks are conducted pursuant to the terms of a Code chapter 28D agreement entered into between the division of tobacco use prevention and control of the Iowa department of public health and the alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce. Pursuant to the terms of the current agreement the alcoholic beverages divisions contracts with state and local law enforcement to conduct two compliance checks per licensed retail establishment per fiscal year. DIVISION XI -- ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DIVISION -- DIRECT SHIPMENT OF WINE. This division of the bill authorizes the direct shipment of wine from out-of-state wine manufacturers to residents of this state under specified circumstances. Current law provides that a winery licensed or permitted pursuant to laws regulating alcoholic beverages in another state which affords Iowa an equal reciprocal shipping privilege may ship into this state by private common carrier, to a person 21 years of age or older, not more than 18 liters of wine per month, for consumption or use by the person. This bill removes the requirement or condition of reciprocity, such that a wine manufacturer in any state may ship wine directly to Iowa residents, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the bill. The bill provides that a wine manufacturer licensed or permitted pursuant to laws regulating alcoholic beverages in another state must obtain a wine direct shipper license to directly ship wine to Iowa residents. A license may be obtained upon receipt by the administrator of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce of a written application from a wine manufacturer, accompanied by a true copy of the manufacturer's current alcoholic beverage license issued in another state, and a copy of the manufacturer's winery license issued by the federal alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau. A $ 25 license fee is additionally required, and the bill specifies that a license may be annually renewed if the information originally submitted is resubmitted each year together with the $ 25 fee. The bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon the direct shipment of wine. The bill provides that no more than 18 liters of wine may be shipped per month by a wine direct shipper licensee to an Iowa resident 21 years of age or older, for the resident's personal use and not for resale. Additionally, the wine must be properly registered with the federal alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau, and manufactured on the winery premises of the wine direct shipper licensee. The bill further specifies that all containers of direct shipped wine must be conspicuously labeled with the words CONTAINS ALCOHOL: SIGNATURE OF PERSON AGE 21 OR OLDER REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY or alternative preapproved wording, and that the containers be shipped by a licensed alcohol carrier. The bill requires a direct shipper licensee to remit to the division an amount equivalent to the $ 1.75 per gallon wine gallonage tax for deposit in the beer and liquor control fund created in Code section 123.53, and subject to the same time, manner, and penalty requirements or provisions as are otherwise applicable to the tax. The bill maintains sales and use tax exemptions, and refund value exemptions, currently applicable to reciprocal shipments of wine in Code section 123.187. Additionally, the bill provides that a direct shipper licensee shall be deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction of the division or any other agency or court in the state, and that the division may perform an audit of shipping records upon request. The bill specifies that an alcohol carrier license shall be issued subject to requirements, fees, and upon application forms to be determined by the administrator by rule. An alcohol carrier licensee shall not be authorized to deliver wine to any person under 21 years of age, or to any person who either is or appears to be in an intoxicated state or condition. The bill requires a licensee to obtain valid proof of identity and age prior to delivery, and the signature of an adult. The bill imposes specified recordkeeping requirements as a condition of maintaining an alcohol carrier license. The bill maintains the current provision that the holder of a permit for the sale or manufacture and sale of wine issued by the division shall be authorized under that permit to ship out of state by private common carrier, to a person 21 years of age or older, not more than 18 liters of wine per month, for consumption or use by the person. The bill subjects violators of the bill's provisions to the license suspension and revocation provisions, and civil penalty provisions, otherwise applicable to permittees in Code section 123.39. DIVISION XII -- DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS -- REORGANIZATION. This division of this bill concerns the department of human rights. The bill reorganizes the department into three divisions, the new division of community advocacy and services, the current division of community action agencies, and the current division of criminal and juvenile justice planning. The current divisions of Latino affairs, status of women, persons with disabilities, deaf services, status of African Americans, Iowans of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage, and Native American affairs, are redesignated as offices and are included within the new division of community advocacy and services. The bill also provides that the administrators of the various divisions of the department, currently appointed by the governor, are eliminated. However, administrators appointed by the department director are retained for the three remaining divisions. In addition, except for the commission on Native American affairs, all commissions within the new division of community advocacy and services are limited to seven voting members. The current human rights administrative-coordinating council is stricken and replaced with a human rights board. In addition, the bill reassigns duties and responsibilities between the offices and commissions within the department. The various subchapters of Code chapter 216A are amended by the bill as follows: ADMINISTRATION: Code section 216A.1 is amended to establish that the department consists of three new divisions, the division of community advocacy and services, the division of community action agencies, and the division of criminal and juvenile justice planning, and renames the current divisions now included within the division of community advocacy and services of the department as offices.

The bill maintains current law that provides that the director of the department of human rights is appointed by the governor, subject to confirmation by the senate. However, the bill provides that the current administrators of the various divisions of the department, appointed by the governor, are eliminated. In addition, the bill also provides that the department director is responsible for appointing the personnel of the department. The rewritten Code section also provides that the department director has the authority to solicit gifts on behalf of the department, commissions, or offices, and can enter into contracts, and issue reports on behalf of the department. Code section 216A.3, concerning the human rights administrative-coordinating council, is stricken and replaced with a human rights board. The new board consists of nine voting members and five nonvoting members. The nine voting members shall be selected by the applicable permanent commissions and councils of the department and two additional voting members shall be appointed by the governor. The nonvoting members shall consist of the director of the department and four members of the general assembly. Current law provides that the administrator of each division of the department is a member of the eliminated council. The bill provides that the duties of the board include adopting the proposed budget for the department, adopting rules of the department, and developing a comprehensive strategic plan for the department. The bill also provides that any substantive action taken by the board must be adopted by a two-thirds vote. New Code section 216A.7 provides that the director or an administrator of one of the divisions created by this bill shall have access to nonconfidential information of state entities that is relevant to the department upon request. DIVISION OF LATINO AFFAIRS: The bill renames the division of Latino affairs as the office of Latino affairs and eliminates the administrator position. Code section 216A.12, concerning the commission of Latino affairs, is amended by the bill. The bill provides that the commission shall consist of seven and not nine members, shall meet at least quarterly each year, and establishes a mechanism for a member not to vote on a matter in which the person has a conflict of interest. Code section 216A.13, concerning the organization of the commission, is repealed and the substance of that Code section is moved to the rewritten Code section 216A.12. Code section 216A.14, concerning commission employees, is stricken and rewritten by the bill. Current law granting authority to the commission to employ personnel is stricken as this authority is provided to the department director in the bill. The rewritten Code section provides for the duties of the office of Latino affairs. The bill transfers to the office current duties of the commission concerning assistance to state agencies and other public organizations relative to Latino persons, training, and work. The bill eliminates the requirement to establish a Latino information center. Code section 216A.15, concerning the duties of the commission on Latino affairs, is amended to strike those duties transferred to the office of Latino affairs. In addition, the bill also strikes the authority of the commission to adopt rules. Code section 216A.16, concerning commission powers to accept gifts, solicit grants, and enter into contracts, and Code section 216A.17, concerning a commission biennial report, are repealed by the bill.

Code section 216A.52, creating the commission on the status of women, Code section 216A.53, concerning commission terms of office, and Code section 216A.54, concerning the meetings of the commission, are stricken and the Code sections rewritten by the bill.

This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs or expenditures under this chapter, and does not modify rights between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible for assistance under the remedial account for any damages or other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which another potentially responsible party is or may be liable.

A claimant may elect to permit the  board   DEPARTMENT  to pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not compensated by the fund against any potentially responsible party, provided the attorney general determines such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If a claimant so elects, the  board's   DEPARTMENT'S  litigation expenses shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the claimant.

NEW SECTION. 685.3 Investigations and prosecutions -- powers of prosecuting authority -- civil actions by individuals as qui tam plaintiffs and as private citizens -- jurisdiction of courts. The attorney general shall diligently investigate a violation under section 685.2. If the attorney general finds that a person has violated or is violating section 685.2, the attorney general may bring a civil action under this section against that person. a. A person may bring a civil action for a violation of this chapter for the person and for the state in the name of the state. The person bringing the action shall be referred to as the qui tam plaintiff. Once filed, the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the court, taking into account the best interest of the parties involved and the public purposes behind this chapter. A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the attorney general. The complaint shall also be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least sixty days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The attorney general may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within sixty days after the attorney general receives both the complaint and the material evidence and the information. The attorney general may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph ""b"". Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to rules of civil procedure. Before the expiration of the sixty-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph ""c"", the attorney general shall do one of the following: Proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the attorney general. Notify the court that the attorney general declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action. When a person brings a valid action under this section, no person other than the attorney general may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action. a. If the attorney general proceeds with the action, the attorney general shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations specified in paragraph ""b"". The attorney general may move to dismiss the action for good cause notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the qui tam plaintiff has been notified by the attorney general of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the qui tam plaintiff with an opportunity to oppose the motion and present evidence at a hearing. The attorney general may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the court determines, after a hearing providing the qui tam plaintiff an opportunity to present evidence, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all of the circumstances. Upon a showing by the attorney general that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the attorney general's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, including but not limited to any of the following: Limiting the number of witnesses the person may call. Limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses. Limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses. Otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation. Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation. If the attorney general elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the attorney general requests, the attorney general shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts at the state's expense. When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may permit the attorney general to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause. Whether or not the attorney general proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the attorney general that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the attorney general's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than sixty days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the sixty-day period upon a further showing in camera that the attorney general has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings. Notwithstanding subsection 2, the attorney general may elect to pursue the state's claim through any alternate remedy available to the state, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final with respect to a party who is also a party to an action under this section, shall be conclusive as to all such parties to an action under this section. For purposes of this paragraph, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the state, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review. If the attorney general proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection 2, the person shall, subject to subparagraph (2), receive at least fifteen percent but not more than twenty-five percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, which includes damages, civil penalties, payments for costs of compliance, and any other economic benefit realized by the state or federal government as a result of the action, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. If the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions specifically in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, or in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award an amount the court considers appropriate, but in no case more than ten percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under subparagraph (1) or (2) shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the appropriate court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. If the attorney general does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than twenty-five percent and not more than thirty percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds, which includes damages, civil penalties, payments for costs of compliance, and any other economic benefit realized by the state or federal government as a result of the action. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the appropriate court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. Whether or not the attorney general proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 685.2 upon which the action was brought, the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph ""a"" or ""b"", taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from the person's role in the violation of section 685.2, the person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the attorney general to continue the action. If the attorney general does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorney fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment. a. A court shall not have jurisdiction over an action brought under subsection 2 against a member of the general assembly, a member of the judiciary, or an executive branch official if the action is based on evidence or information known to the attorney general when the action was brought. A person shall not bring an action under subsection 2 which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil penalty proceeding in which the state is already a party. Upon motion of the attorney general, the court may in consideration of all the equities, dismiss a qui tam plaintiff if the elements of the actionable false claims alleged in the qui tam complaint have been publicly disclosed specifically in the news media or in a publicly disseminated governmental report, at the time the complaint is filed. The state is not liable for expenses which a person incurs in bringing an action under this section. Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by the person's employer because of lawful acts performed by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, two times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorney fees. An employee may bring an action in the appropriate court of the state for the relief provided in this subsection. NEW SECTION. 685.4 Limitation of actions -- burden of proof. A civil action under section 685.3 shall not be brought more than ten years after the date on which the violation was committed. A civil action under section 685.3 may be brought based on activity prior to January 1, 2007, if the limitations period pursuant to subsection 1 has not lapsed. In any action brought under section 685.3, the attorney general or the qui tam plaintiff shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a guilty verdict rendered in a criminal proceeding charging false statements or fraud, whether upon a verdict after trial or upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, shall estop the defendant from denying the essential elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under section 685.3, subsection 1, 2, or 3. NEW SECTION. 685.5 Remedies under other laws -- application. The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive, and the remedies provided for in this chapter shall be in addition to any other remedies provided for in any other law or available under common law.
