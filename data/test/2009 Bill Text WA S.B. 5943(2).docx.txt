Text BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON: A new section is added to chapter 74.13 RCW to read as follows: The legislature declares that the safety and well-being of children and families is essential to the social and economic health of Washington. It is the duty of the state to provide children at risk of out-of-home placement and their families with reasonable opportunities to access supportive services that enhance their safety and well-being. The legislature intends the new programmatic and administrative changes required in this act to be accomplished in conformance with this foregoing principle. The legislature finds that research in the area of child safety and well-being supports the conclusion that a restructuring of the administration and delivery of child welfare services through the use of performance-based contracts can enhance safety and well-being, when done so in a careful, well-planned and collaborative manner. The legislature intends that the execution of performance-based contracts which transfer the delivery of child welfare services to entities other than the department be done without restricting who may seek to participate in the procurement process of the contracts. The legislature intends that the department shall retain those positions necessary to provide child protective and investigative services and to administer performance-based contracts. The legislature, in creating the committee in section 6 of this act, is establishing the mechanism to design, in collaboration with the department, the transition to performance-based contracts in the delivery of out-of-home care and case management services. RCW 74.13.020 and 1999 c 267 s 7 are each amended to read as follows: As used in Title 74 RCW, child welfare services shall be defined as public social services including adoption services which strengthen, supplement, or substitute for, parental care and supervision for the purpose of:   (1) Preventing or remedying, or assisting in the solution of problems which may result in families in conflict, or the neglect, abuse, exploitation, or criminal behavior of children;   (2) Protecting and caring for dependent or neglected children;   (3) Assisting children who are in conflict with their parents, and assisting parents who are in conflict with their children with services designed to resolve such conflicts;   (4) Protecting and promoting the welfare of children, including the strengthening of their own homes where possible, or, where needed;   (5) Providing adequate care of children away from their homes in foster family homes or day care or other child care agencies or facilities.   As used in this chapter, child means a person less than eighteen years of age.   The department's duty to provide services to homeless families with children is set forth in RCW 43.20A.790 and in appropriations provided by the legislature for implementation of the plan.   FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CHAPTER:  ""CASE MANAGEMENT"" MEANS THOSE SERVICES, INCLUDING PERMANENCY SERVICES, TO A CHILD FOR WHOM THE DEPARTMENT HAS LEGAL CUSTODY, INCLUDING CASEWORKER-CHILD VISITS, FAMILY VISITS, THE CONVENING OF FAMILY GROUP CONFERENCES, THE DEVELOPMENT AND REVISION OF THE CASE PLAN, THE COORDINATION AND MONITORING OF SERVICES NEEDED BY THE CHILD AND FAMILY, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF COURT-RELATED DUTIES, INCLUDING PREPARING COURT REPORTS, ATTENDING JUDICIAL HEARINGS AND PERMANENCY HEARINGS, AND ENSURING THAT THE CHILD IS PROGRESSING TOWARD PERMANENCY WITHIN STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES, INCLUDING THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT.

When considering whether a clear and present danger exists, evidence of a parent's substance abuse as a contributing factor to negligent treatment or maltreatment shall be given great weight. The fact that siblings share a bedroom is not, in and of itself, negligent treatment or maltreatment.

As a condition for receiving funded remedial services, the court may inquire into the parent's ability to pay for all or part of such services or may require that the parent make appropriate applications for funding to alternative funding sources for such services. If court-ordered remedial services are unavailable for any reason, including lack of funding, lack of services, or language barriers, the department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall promptly notify the court that the parent is unable to engage in the treatment due to the inability to access such services.

The primary purpose of the shelter care hearing is to determine whether the child can be immediately and safely returned home while the adjudication of the dependency is pending. Any parent, guardian, or legal custodian who for good cause is unable to attend the shelter care hearing may request that a subsequent shelter care hearing be scheduled. The request shall be made to the clerk of the court where the petition is filed prior to the initial shelter care hearing. Upon the request of the parent, the court shall schedule the hearing within seventy-two hours of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The clerk shall notify all other parties of the hearing by any reasonable means.  IF IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CHILD WILL REMAIN IN SHELTER CARE LONGER THAN SEVENTY-TWO HOURS, THE SUPERVISING AGENCY SHALL ASSUME CASE MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CASE.  The  department of social and health services   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall submit a recommendation to the court as to the further need for shelter care in all cases in which  it is the petitioner   THE CHILD WILL REMAIN IN SHELTER CARE LONGER THAN THE SEVENTY-TWO HOUR PERIOD  .

All parties have the right to present testimony to the court regarding the need or lack of need for shelter care. Hearsay evidence before the court regarding the need or lack of need for shelter care must be supported by sworn testimony, affidavit, or declaration of the person offering such evidence. At the commencement of the hearing, the court shall notify the parent, guardian, or custodian of the following: The parent, guardian, or custodian has the right to a shelter care hearing; The nature of the shelter care hearing, the rights of the parents, and the proceedings that will follow; and If the parent, guardian, or custodian is not represented by counsel, the right to be represented.

A parent may not waive his or her right to the shelter care hearing unless he or she appears in court and the court determines that the waiver is knowing and voluntary. Regardless of whether the court accepts the parental waiver of the shelter care hearing, the court must provide notice to the parents of their rights required under (a) of this subsection and make the finding required under subsection (4) of this section. At the shelter care hearing the court shall examine the need for shelter care and inquire into the status of the case. The paramount consideration for the court shall be the health, welfare, and safety of the child. At a minimum, the court shall inquire into the following: Whether the notice required under RCW 13.34.062 was given to all known parents, guardians, or legal custodians of the child. The court shall make an express finding as to whether the notice required under RCW 13.34.062 was given to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian. If actual notice was not given to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and the whereabouts of such person is known or can be ascertained, the court shall order  the supervising agency or  the department  of social and health services  to make reasonable efforts to advise the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the status of the case, including the date and time of any subsequent hearings, and their rights under RCW 13.34.090; Whether the child can be safely returned home while the adjudication of the dependency is pending; What efforts have been made to place the child with a relative; What services were provided to the family to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home; Is the placement proposed by the  DEPARTMENT OR SUPERVISING  agency the least disruptive and most family-like setting that meets the needs of the child; Whether it is in the best interest of the child to remain enrolled in the school, developmental program, or child care the child was in prior to placement and what efforts have been made to maintain the child in the school, program, or child care if it would be in the best interest of the child to remain in the same school, program, or child care; Appointment of a guardian ad litem or attorney; Whether the child is or may be an Indian child as defined in 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1903, whether the provisions of the Indian child welfare act apply, and whether there is compliance with the Indian child welfare act, including notice to the child's tribe; Whether, as provided in RCW 26.44.063, restraining orders, or orders expelling an allegedly abusive household member from the home of a nonabusive parent, guardian, or legal custodian, will allow the child to safely remain in the home; Whether any orders for examinations, evaluations, or immediate services are needed. The court may not order a parent to undergo examinations, evaluation, or services at the shelter care hearing unless the parent agrees to the examination, evaluation, or service; The terms and conditions for parental, sibling, and family visitation. The court shall release a child alleged to be dependent to the care, custody, and control of the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian unless the court finds there is reasonable cause to believe that: After consideration of the specific services that have been provided, reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home and to make it possible for the child to return home; and The child has no parent, guardian, or legal custodian to provide supervision and care for such child; or The release of such child would present a serious threat of substantial harm to such child, notwithstanding an order entered pursuant to RCW 26.44.063; or The parent, guardian, or custodian to whom the child could be released has been charged with violating RCW 9A.40.060 or 9A.40.070. If the court does not release the child to his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the court shall order placement with a relative, unless there is reasonable cause to believe the health, safety, or welfare of the child would be jeopardized or that the efforts to reunite the parent and child will be hindered. The relative must be willing and available to: Care for the child and be able to meet any special needs of the child; Facilitate the child's visitation with siblings, if such visitation is part of the supervising agency's plan or is ordered by the court; and Cooperate with the department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  in providing necessary background checks and home studies. If the child was not initially placed with a relative, and the court does not release the child to his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the supervising agency shall make reasonable efforts to locate a relative pursuant to RCW 13.34.060(1). If a relative is not available, the court shall order continued shelter care or order placement with another suitable person, and the court shall set forth its reasons for the order. If the court orders placement of the child with a person not related to the child and not licensed to provide foster care, the placement is subject to all terms and conditions of this section that apply to relative placements. Any placement with a relative, or other person approved by the court pursuant to this section, shall be contingent upon cooperation with the  SUPERVISING  agency  'S  case plan and compliance with court orders related to the care and supervision of the child including, but not limited to, court orders regarding parent-child contacts, sibling contacts, and any other conditions imposed by the court. Noncompliance with the case plan or court order is grounds for removal of the child from the home of the relative or other person, subject to review by the court. Uncertainty by a parent, guardian, legal custodian, relative, or other suitable person that the alleged abuser has in fact abused the child shall not, alone, be the basis upon which a child is removed from the care of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian under (a) of this subsection, nor shall it be a basis, alone, to preclude placement with a relative under (b) of this subsection or with another suitable person under (d) of this subsection. A shelter care order issued pursuant to this section shall include the requirement for a case conference as provided in RCW 13.34.067. However, if the parent is not present at the shelter care hearing, or does not agree to the case conference, the court shall not include the requirement for the case conference in the shelter care order. If the court orders a case conference, the shelter care order shall include notice to all parties and establish the date, time, and location of the case conference which shall be no later than thirty days before the fact-finding hearing. The court may order another conference, case staffing, or hearing as an alternative to the case conference required under RCW 13.34.067 so long as the conference, case staffing, or hearing ordered by the court meets all requirements under RCW 13.34.067, including the requirement of a written agreement specifying the services to be provided to the parent. A shelter care order issued pursuant to this section may be amended at any time with notice and hearing thereon. The shelter care decision of placement shall be modified only upon a showing of change in circumstances. No child may be placed in shelter care for longer than thirty days without an order, signed by the judge, authorizing continued shelter care. An order releasing the child on any conditions specified in this section may at any time be amended, with notice and hearing thereon, so as to return the child to shelter care for failure of the parties to conform to the conditions originally imposed. The court shall consider whether nonconformance with any conditions resulted from circumstances beyond the control of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and give weight to that fact before ordering return of the child to shelter care. If a child is returned home from shelter care a second time in the case, or if the supervisor of the caseworker deems it necessary, the multidisciplinary team may be reconvened. If a child is returned home from shelter care a second time in the case a law enforcement officer must be present and file a report to the department. RCW 13.34.067 and 2004 c 147 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: Following shelter care and no later than thirty days prior to fact-finding, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall convene a case conference as required in the shelter care order to develop and specify in a written service agreement the expectations of both the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  and the parent regarding voluntary services for the parent. The case conference shall include the parent, counsel for the parent, caseworker, counsel for the state, guardian ad litem, counsel for the child, and any other person agreed upon by the parties. Once the shelter care order is entered, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  is not required to provide additional notice of the case conference to any participants in the case conference. The written service agreement expectations must correlate with the court's findings at the shelter care hearing. The written service agreement must set forth specific services to be provided to the parent. The case conference agreement must be agreed to and signed by the parties. The court shall not consider the content of the discussions at the case conference at the time of the fact-finding hearing for the purposes of establishing that the child is a dependent child, and the court shall not consider any documents or written materials presented at the case conference but not incorporated into the case conference agreement, unless the documents or written materials were prepared for purposes other than or as a result of the case conference and are otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence. At any other stage in a dependency proceeding, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  , upon the parent's request, shall convene a case conference. RCW 13.34.069 and 2007 c 409 s 2 are each amended to read as follows: If a child is placed in the custody of the  department of social and health services or other  supervising agency, immediately following the shelter care hearing, an order and authorization regarding health care and education records for the child shall be entered. The order shall: Provide the  department or other  supervising agency with the right to inspect and copy all health, medical, mental health, and education records of the child; Authorize and direct any agency, hospital, doctor, nurse, dentist, orthodontist, or other health care provider, therapist, drug or alcohol treatment provider, psychologist, psychiatrist, or mental health clinic, or health or medical records custodian or document management company, or school or school organization to permit the department or other supervising agency to inspect and to obtain copies of any records relating to the child involved in the case, without the further consent of the parent or guardian of the child; and Grant the department or other supervising agency or its designee the authority and responsibility, where applicable, to: Notify the child's school that the child is in out-of-home placement; Enroll the child in school; Request the school transfer records; Request and authorize evaluation of special needs; Attend parent or teacher conferences; Excuse absences; Grant permission for extracurricular activities; Authorize medications which need to be administered during school hours and sign for medical needs that arise during school hours; and Complete or update school emergency records. Access to records under this section is subject to the child's consent where required by other state and federal laws. RCW 13.34.094 and 2004 c 147 s 3 are each amended to read as follows: The department  , OR SUPERVISING AGENCY AFTER THE SHELTER CARE HEARING,  shall, within existing resources, provide to parents requesting or participating in a multidisciplinary team, family group conference, case conference, or prognostic staffing information that describes these processes prior to the processes being undertaken. RCW 13.34.096 and 2007 c 409 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: The  department of social and health services or other  supervising agency shall provide the child's foster parents, preadoptive parents, or other caregivers with notice of their right to be heard prior to each proceeding held with respect to the child in juvenile court under this chapter. The rights to notice and to be heard apply only to persons with whom a child has been placed by the department  BEFORE SHELTER CARE  or  other  supervising agency and who are providing care to the child at the time of the proceeding. This section shall not be construed to grant party status to any person solely on the basis of such notice and right to be heard. RCW 13.34.125 and 1999 c 173 s 2 are each amended to read as follows: In those cases where an alleged father, birth parent, or parent has indicated his or her intention to make a voluntary adoption plan for the child and has agreed to the termination of his or her parental rights, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall follow the wishes of the alleged father, birth parent, or parent regarding the proposed adoptive placement of the child, if the court determines that the adoption is in the best interest of the child, and the prospective adoptive parents chosen by the alleged father, birth parent, or parent are properly qualified to adopt in compliance with the standards in this chapter and chapter 26.33 RCW. If the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  has filed a termination petition, an alleged father's, birth parent's, or parent's preferences regarding the proposed adoptive placement of the child shall be given consideration. RCW 13.34.130 and 2007 c 413 s 6 and 2007 c 412 s 2 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: If, after a fact-finding hearing pursuant to RCW 13.34.110, it has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the child is dependent within the meaning of RCW 13.34.030 after consideration of the social study prepared pursuant to RCW 13.34.110 and after a disposition hearing has been held pursuant to RCW 13.34.110, the court shall enter an order of disposition pursuant to this section. The court shall order one of the following dispositions of the case: Order a disposition other than removal of the child from his or her home, which shall provide a program designed to alleviate the immediate danger to the child, to mitigate or cure any damage the child has already suffered, and to aid the parents so that the child will not be endangered in the future. In determining the disposition, the court should choose those services, including housing assistance, that least interfere with family autonomy and are adequate to protect the child. Order the child to be removed from his or her home and into the custody, control, and care of a relative  or the department  or a  licensed child placing   SUPERVISING  agency for supervision of the child's placement. The  department or   SUPERVISING  agency  supervising the child's placement  has the authority to place the child, subject to review and approval by the court (i) with a relative as defined in RCW 74.15.020(2)(a), (ii) in a foster family home or group care facility licensed pursuant to chapter 74.15 RCW, or (iii) in the home of another suitable person if the child or family has a preexisting relationship with that person, and the person has completed all required criminal history background checks and otherwise appears to the department or supervising agency to be suitable and competent to provide care for the child. Absent good cause, the department or supervising agency shall follow the wishes of the natural parent regarding the placement of the child in accordance with RCW 13.34.260. The department or supervising agency may only place a child with a person not related to the child as defined in RCW 74.15.020(2)(a) when the court finds that such placement is in the best interest of the child. Unless there is reasonable cause to believe that the health, safety, or welfare of the child would be jeopardized or that efforts to reunite the parent and child will be hindered, such child shall be placed with a person who is: (A) Related to the child as defined in RCW 74.15.020(2)(a) with whom the child has a relationship and is comfortable; and (B) willing and available to care for the child. Placement of the child with a relative under this subsection shall be given preference by the court. An order for out-of-home placement may be made only if the court finds that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home and to make it possible for the child to return home, specifying the services that have been provided to the child and the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian, and that preventive services have been offered or provided and have failed to prevent the need for out-of-home placement, unless the health, safety, and welfare of the child cannot be protected adequately in the home, and that: There is no parent or guardian available to care for such child; The parent, guardian, or legal custodian is not willing to take custody of the child; or The court finds, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, a manifest danger exists that the child will suffer serious abuse or neglect if the child is not removed from the home and an order under RCW 26.44.063 would not protect the child from danger. If the court has ordered a child removed from his or her home pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, the court shall consider whether it is in a child's best interest to be placed with, have contact with, or have visits with siblings. There shall be a presumption that such placement, contact, or visits are in the best interests of the child provided that: The court has jurisdiction over all siblings subject to the order of placement, contact, or visitation pursuant to petitions filed under this chapter or the parents of a child for whom there is no jurisdiction are willing to agree; and There is no reasonable cause to believe that the health, safety, or welfare of any child subject to the order of placement, contact, or visitation would be jeopardized or that efforts to reunite the parent and child would be hindered by such placement, contact, or visitation. In no event shall parental visitation time be reduced in order to provide sibling visitation. The court may also order placement, contact, or visitation of a child with a step-brother or step-sister provided that in addition to the factors in (a) of this subsection, the child has a relationship and is comfortable with the step-sibling. If the court has ordered a child removed from his or her home pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section and placed into nonparental or nonrelative care, the court shall order a placement that allows the child to remain in the same school he or she attended prior to the initiation of the dependency proceeding when such a placement is practical and in the child's best interest. If the court has ordered a child removed from his or her home pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, the court may order that a petition seeking termination of the parent and child relationship be filed if the requirements of RCW 13.34.132 are met. If there is insufficient information at the time of the disposition hearing upon which to base a determination regarding the suitability of a proposed placement with a relative, the child shall remain in foster care and the court shall direct the  DEPARTMENT OR  supervising agency to conduct necessary background investigations as provided in chapter 74.15 RCW and report the results of such investigation to the court within thirty days. However, if such relative appears otherwise suitable and competent to provide care and treatment, the criminal history background check need not be completed before placement, but as soon as possible after placement. Any placements with relatives, pursuant to this section, shall be contingent upon cooperation by the relative with the agency case plan and compliance with court orders related to the care and supervision of the child including, but not limited to, court orders regarding parent-child contacts, sibling contacts, and any other conditions imposed by the court. Noncompliance with the case plan or court order shall be grounds for removal of the child from the relative's home, subject to review by the court. RCW 13.34.136 and 2008 c 267 s 3 and 2008 c 152 s 2 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: Whenever a child is ordered removed from the home, a permanency plan shall be developed no later than sixty days from the time the supervising agency assumes responsibility for providing services, including placing the child, or at the time of a hearing under RCW 13.34.130, whichever occurs first. The permanency planning process continues until a permanency planning goal is achieved or dependency is dismissed. The planning process shall include reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent's home. The  SUPERVISING  agency supervising the dependency shall submit a written permanency plan to all parties and the court not less than fourteen days prior to the scheduled hearing. Responsive reports of parties not in agreement with the  DEPARTMENT'S OR  supervising agency's proposed permanency plan must be provided to the  DEPARTMENT OR  supervising agency, all other parties, and the court at least seven days prior to the hearing. The permanency plan shall include: A permanency plan of care that shall identify one of the following outcomes as a primary goal and may identify additional outcomes as alternative goals: Return of the child to the home of the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian; adoption; guardianship; permanent legal custody; long-term relative or foster care, until the child is age eighteen, with a written agreement between the parties and the care provider; successful completion of a responsible living skills program; or independent living, if appropriate and if the child is age sixteen or older. The  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall not discharge a child to an independent living situation before the child is eighteen years of age unless the child becomes emancipated pursuant to chapter 13.64 RCW; Unless the court has ordered, pursuant to RCW 13.34.130(5), that a termination petition be filed, a specific plan as to where the child will be placed, what steps will be taken to return the child home, what steps the  SUPERVISING  agency will take to promote existing appropriate sibling relationships and/or facilitate placement together or contact in accordance with the best interests of each child, and what actions the  SUPERVISING  agency will take to maintain parent-child ties. All aspects of the plan shall include the goal of achieving permanence for the child. The  SUPERVISING  agency  'S  plan shall specify what services the parents will be offered to enable them to resume custody, what requirements the parents must meet to resume custody, and a time limit for each service plan and parental requirement. Visitation is the right of the family, including the child and the parent, in cases in which visitation is in the best interest of the child. Early, consistent, and frequent visitation is crucial for maintaining parent-child relationships and making it possible for parents and children to safely reunify. The  SUPERVISING  agency shall encourage the maximum parent and child and sibling contact possible, when it is in the best interest of the child, including regular visitation and participation by the parents in the care of the child while the child is in placement. Visitation shall not be limited as a sanction for a parent's failure to comply with court orders or services where the health, safety, or welfare of the child is not at risk as a result of the visitation. Visitation may be limited or denied only if the court determines that such limitation or denial is necessary to protect the child's health, safety, or welfare. The court and the  SUPERVISING  agency should rely upon community resources, relatives, foster parents, and other appropriate persons to provide transportation and supervision for visitation to the extent that such resources are available, and appropriate, and the child's safety would not be compromised. A child shall be placed as close to the child's home as possible, preferably in the child's own neighborhood, unless the court finds that placement at a greater distance is necessary to promote the child's or parents' well-being. The plan shall state whether both in-state and, where appropriate, out-of-state placement options have been considered by the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  . Unless it is not in the best interests of the child, whenever practical, the plan should ensure the child remains enrolled in the school the child was attending at the time the child entered foster care. The  SUPERVISING  agency  charged with supervising a child in placement  shall provide all reasonable services that are available within the  SUPERVISING  agency, or within the community, or those services which the department has existing contracts to purchase. It shall report to the court if it is unable to provide such services; and If the court has ordered, pursuant to RCW 13.34.130(5), that a termination petition be filed, a specific plan as to where the child will be placed, what steps will be taken to achieve permanency for the child, services to be offered or provided to the child, and, if visitation would be in the best interests of the child, a recommendation to the court regarding visitation between parent and child pending a fact-finding hearing on the termination petition. The  SUPERVISING  agency shall not be required to develop a plan of services for the parents or provide services to the parents if the court orders a termination petition be filed. However, reasonable efforts to ensure visitation and contact between siblings shall be made unless there is reasonable cause to believe the best interests of the child or siblings would be jeopardized. Permanency planning goals should be achieved at the earliest possible date. If the child has been in out-of-home care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, the court shall require the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  to file a petition seeking termination of parental rights in accordance with RCW 13.34.145(3)(b)(vi). In cases where parental rights have been terminated, the child is legally free for adoption, and adoption has been identified as the primary permanency planning goal, it shall be a goal to complete the adoption within six months following entry of the termination order. If the court determines that the continuation of reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from his or her home or to safely return the child home should not be part of the permanency plan of care for the child, reasonable efforts shall be made to place the child in a timely manner and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. The identified outcomes and goals of the permanency plan may change over time based upon the circumstances of the particular case. The court shall consider the child's relationships with the child's siblings in accordance with RCW 13.34.130(3). For purposes related to permanency planning: ""Guardianship"" means a dependency guardianship or a legal guardianship pursuant to chapter 11.88 RCW or equivalent laws of another state or a federally recognized Indian tribe. ""Permanent custody order"" means a custody order entered pursuant to chapter 26.10 RCW. ""Permanent legal custody"" means legal custody pursuant to chapter 26.10 RCW or equivalent laws of another state or a federally recognized Indian tribe. RCW 13.34.138 and 2007 c 413 s 8 and 2007 c 410 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: Except for children whose cases are reviewed by a citizen review board under chapter 13.70 RCW, the status of all children found to be dependent shall be reviewed by the court at least every six months from the beginning date of the placement episode or the date dependency is established, whichever is first. The purpose of the hearing shall be to review the progress of the parties and determine whether court supervision should continue. The initial review hearing shall be an in-court review and shall be set six months from the beginning date of the placement episode or no more than ninety days from the entry of the disposition order, whichever comes first. The requirements for the initial review hearing, including the in-court review requirement, shall be accomplished within existing resources. The initial review hearing may be a permanency planning hearing when necessary to meet the time frames set forth in RCW 13.34.145 (1)(a) or 13.34.134. A child shall not be returned home at the review hearing unless the court finds that a reason for removal as set forth in RCW 13.34.130 no longer exists. The parents, guardian, or legal custodian shall report to the court the efforts they have made to correct the conditions which led to removal. If a child is returned, casework supervision  BY THE SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall continue for a period of six months, at which time there shall be a hearing on the need for continued intervention. Prior to the child returning home, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  must complete the following: Identify all adults residing in the home and conduct background checks on those persons; Identify any persons who may act as a caregiver for the child in addition to the parent with whom the child is being placed and determine whether such persons are in need of any services in order to ensure the safety of the child, regardless of whether such persons are a party to the dependency. The department or supervising agency may recommend to the court and the court may order that placement of the child in the parent's home be contingent on or delayed based on the need for such persons to engage in or complete services to ensure the safety of the child prior to placement. If services are recommended for the caregiver, and the caregiver fails to engage in or follow through with the recommended services, the department or supervising agency must promptly notify the court; and Notify the parent with whom the child is being placed that he or she has an ongoing duty to notify the department or supervising agency of all persons who reside in the home or who may act as a caregiver for the child both prior to the placement of the child in the home and subsequent to the placement of the child in the home as long as the court retains jurisdiction of the dependency proceeding or the department is providing or monitoring either remedial services to the parent or services to ensure the safety of the child to any caregivers. Caregivers may be required to engage in services under this subsection solely for the purpose of ensuring the present and future safety of a child who is a ward of the court. This subsection does not grant party status to any individual not already a party to the dependency proceeding, create an entitlement to services or a duty on the part of the  department or  supervising agency to provide services, or create judicial authority to order the provision of services to any person other than for the express purposes of this section or RCW 13.34.025 or if the services are unavailable or unsuitable or the person is not eligible for such services. If the child is not returned home, the court shall establish in writing: Whether the  SUPERVISING  agency is making reasonable efforts to provide services to the family and eliminate the need for placement of the child. If additional services, including housing assistance, are needed to facilitate the return of the child to the child's parents, the court shall order that reasonable services be offered specifying such services; Whether there has been compliance with the case plan by the child, the child's parents, and the  SUPERVISING  agency supervising the placement; Whether progress has been made toward correcting the problems that necessitated the child's placement in out-of-home care; Whether the services set forth in the case plan and the responsibilities of the parties need to be clarified or modified due to the availability of additional information or changed circumstances; Whether there is a continuing need for placement; Whether the child is in an appropriate placement which adequately meets all physical, emotional, and educational needs; Whether preference has been given to placement with the child's relatives; Whether both in-state and, where appropriate, out-of-state placements have been considered; Whether the parents have visited the child and any reasons why visitation has not occurred or has been infrequent; Whether terms of visitation need to be modified; Whether the court-approved long-term permanent plan for the child remains the best plan for the child; Whether any additional court orders need to be made to move the case toward permanency; and The projected date by which the child will be returned home or other permanent plan of care will be implemented. The court at the review hearing may order that a petition seeking termination of the parent and child relationship be filed. In any case in which the court orders that a dependent child may be returned to or remain in the child's home, the in-home placement shall be contingent upon the following: The compliance of the parents with court orders related to the care and supervision of the child, including compliance with  an   THE SUPERVISING  agency  'S  case plan; and The continued participation of the parents, if applicable, in available substance abuse or mental health treatment if substance abuse or mental illness was a contributing factor to the removal of the child. The following may be grounds for removal of the child from the home, subject to review by the court: Noncompliance by the parents with the  SUPERVISING  agency  'S  case plan or court order; The parent's inability, unwillingness, or failure to participate in available services or treatment for themselves or the child, including substance abuse treatment if a parent's substance abuse was a contributing factor to the abuse or neglect; or The failure of the parents to successfully and substantially complete available services or treatment for themselves or the child, including substance abuse treatment if a parent's substance abuse was a contributing factor to the abuse or neglect. In a pending dependency case in which the court orders that a dependent child may be returned home and that child is later removed from the home, the court shall hold a review hearing within thirty days from the date of removal to determine whether the permanency plan should be changed, a termination petition should be filed, or other action is warranted. The best interests of the child shall be the court's primary consideration in the review hearing. The court's ability to order housing assistance under RCW 13.34.130 and this section is: (a) Limited to cases in which homelessness or the lack of adequate and safe housing is the primary reason for an out-of-home placement; and (b) subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose. The court shall consider the child's relationship with siblings in accordance with RCW 13.34.130(3). RCW 13.34.145 and 2008 c 152 s 3 are each amended to read as follows: The purpose of a permanency planning hearing is to review the permanency plan for the child, inquire into the welfare of the child and progress of the case, and reach decisions regarding the permanent placement of the child. A permanency planning hearing shall be held in all cases where the child has remained in out-of-home care for at least nine months and an adoption decree, guardianship order, or permanent custody order has not previously been entered. The hearing shall take place no later than twelve months following commencement of the current placement episode. Whenever a child is removed from the home of a dependency guardian or long-term relative or foster care provider, and the child is not returned to the home of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian but is placed in out-of-home care, a permanency planning hearing shall take place no later than twelve months, as provided in this section, following the date of removal unless, prior to the hearing, the child returns to the home of the dependency guardian or long-term care provider, the child is placed in the home of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, an adoption decree, guardianship order, or a permanent custody order is entered, or the dependency is dismissed. Permanency planning goals should be achieved at the earliest possible date, preferably before the child has been in out-of-home care for fifteen months. In cases where parental rights have been terminated, the child is legally free for adoption, and adoption has been identified as the primary permanency planning goal, it shall be a goal to complete the adoption within six months following entry of the termination order. No later than ten working days prior to the permanency planning hearing, the  SUPERVISING  agency having custody of the child shall submit a written permanency plan to the court and shall mail a copy of the plan to all parties and their legal counsel, if any. At the permanency planning hearing, the court shall conduct the following inquiry: If a goal of long-term foster or relative care has been achieved prior to the permanency planning hearing, the court shall review the child's status to determine whether the placement and the plan for the child's care remain appropriate. In cases where the primary permanency planning goal has not been achieved, the court shall inquire regarding the reasons why the primary goal has not been achieved and determine what needs to be done to make it possible to achieve the primary goal. The court shall review the permanency plan prepared by the agency and make explicit findings regarding each of the following: The continuing necessity for, and the safety and appropriateness of, the placement; The extent of compliance with the permanency plan by the  SUPERVISING  agency and any other service providers, the child's parents, the child, and the child's guardian, if any; The extent of any efforts to involve appropriate service providers in addition to  SUPERVISING  agency staff in planning to meet the special needs of the child and the child's parents; The progress toward eliminating the causes for the child's placement outside of his or her home and toward returning the child safely to his or her home or obtaining a permanent placement for the child; The date by which it is likely that the child will be returned to his or her home or placed for adoption, with a guardian or in some other alternative permanent placement; and If the child has been placed outside of his or her home for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, not including any period during which the child was a runaway from the out-of-home placement or the first six months of any period during which the child was returned to his or her home for a trial home visit, the appropriateness of the permanency plan, whether reasonable efforts were made by the  SUPERVISING  agency to achieve the goal of the permanency plan, and the circumstances which prevent the child from any of the following: Being returned safely to his or her home; Having a petition for the involuntary termination of parental rights filed on behalf of the child; Being placed for adoption; Being placed with a guardian; Being placed in the home of a fit and willing relative of the child; or Being placed in some other alternative permanent placement, including independent living or long-term foster care. At this hearing, the court shall order the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  to file a petition seeking termination of parental rights if the child has been in out-of-home care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months since the date the dependency petition was filed unless the court makes a good cause exception as to why the filing of a termination of parental rights petition is not appropriate. Any good cause finding shall be reviewed at all subsequent hearings pertaining to the child. For purposes of this section, ""good cause exception"" includes but is not limited to the following: The child is being cared for by a relative; the department has not provided to the child's family such services as the court and the department have deemed necessary for the child's safe return home; or the department has documented in the case plan a compelling reason for determining that filing a petition to terminate parental rights would not be in the child's best interests. If the permanency plan identifies independent living as a goal, the court shall make a finding that the provision of services to assist the child in making a transition from foster care to independent living will allow the child to manage his or her financial, personal, social, educational, and nonfinancial affairs prior to approving independent living as a permanency plan of care. The permanency plan shall also specifically identify the services that will be provided to assist the child to make a successful transition from foster care to independent living. The  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall not discharge a child to an independent living situation before the child is eighteen years of age unless the child becomes emancipated pursuant to chapter 13.64 RCW. If the child has resided in the home of a foster parent or relative for more than six months prior to the permanency planning hearing, the court shall also enter a finding regarding whether the foster parent or relative was informed of the hearing as required in RCW 74.13.280, 13.34.215(5), and 13.34.096. In all cases, at the permanency planning hearing, the court shall: Order the permanency plan prepared by the  SUPERVISING  agency to be implemented; or Modify the permanency plan, and order implementation of the modified plan; and Order the child returned home only if the court finds that a reason for removal as set forth in RCW 13.34.130 no longer exists; or Order the child to remain in out-of-home care for a limited specified time period while efforts are made to implement the permanency plan. Following the first permanency planning hearing, the court shall hold a further permanency planning hearing in accordance with this section at least once every twelve months until a permanency planning goal is achieved or the dependency is dismissed, whichever occurs first. Prior to the second permanency planning hearing, the  SUPERVISING  agency that has custody of the child shall consider whether to file a petition for termination of parental rights. If the court orders the child returned home, casework supervision  BY THE SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall continue for at least six months, at which time a review hearing shall be held pursuant to RCW 13.34.138, and the court shall determine the need for continued intervention. The juvenile court may hear a petition for permanent legal custody when: (a) The court has ordered implementation of a permanency plan that includes permanent legal custody; and (b) the party pursuing the permanent legal custody is the party identified in the permanency plan as the prospective legal custodian. During the pendency of such proceeding, the court shall conduct review hearings and further permanency planning hearings as provided in this chapter. At the conclusion of the legal guardianship or permanent legal custody proceeding, a juvenile court hearing shall be held for the purpose of determining whether dependency should be dismissed. If a guardianship or permanent custody order has been entered, the dependency shall be dismissed. Continued juvenile court jurisdiction under this chapter shall not be a barrier to the entry of an order establishing a legal guardianship or permanent legal custody when the requirements of subsection (8) of this section are met. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to limit the ability of the  SUPERVISING  agency that has custody of the child to file a petition for termination of parental rights or a guardianship petition at any time following the establishment of dependency. Upon the filing of such a petition, a fact-finding hearing shall be scheduled and held in accordance with this chapter unless the  SUPERVISING  agency requests dismissal of the petition prior to the hearing or unless the parties enter an agreed order terminating parental rights, establishing guardianship, or otherwise resolving the matter. The approval of a permanency plan that does not contemplate return of the child to the parent does not relieve the supervising agency of its obligation to provide reasonable services, under this chapter, intended to effectuate the return of the child to the parent, including but not limited to, visitation rights. The court shall consider the child's relationships with siblings in accordance with RCW 13.34.130. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to limit the procedural due process rights of any party in a termination or guardianship proceeding filed under this chapter. RCW 13.34.155 and 2000 c 135 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: The court hearing the dependency petition may hear and determine issues related to chapter 26.10 RCW in a dependency proceeding as necessary to facilitate a permanency plan for the child or children as part of the dependency disposition order or a dependency review order or as otherwise necessary to implement a permanency plan of care for a child. The parents, guardians, or legal custodian of the child must agree, subject to court approval, to establish a permanent custody order. This agreed order may have the concurrence of the other parties to the dependency including the supervising agency, the guardian ad litem of the child, and the child if age twelve or older, and must also be in the best interests of the child. If the petitioner for a custody order under chapter 26.10 RCW is not a party to the dependency proceeding, he or she must agree on the record or by the filing of a declaration to the entry of a custody order. Once an order is entered under chapter 26.10 RCW, and the dependency petition dismissed, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall not continue to supervise the placement. Any court order determining issues under chapter 26.10 RCW is subject to modification upon the same showing and standards as a court order determining Title 26 RCW issues. Any order entered in the dependency court establishing or modifying a permanent legal custody order under chapter 26.10 RCW shall also be filed in the chapter 26.10 RCW action by the prevailing party. Once filed, any order establishing or modifying permanent legal custody shall survive dismissal of the dependency proceeding. RCW 13.34.174 and 2000 c 122 s 23 are each amended to read as follows: The provisions of this section shall apply when a court orders a party to undergo an alcohol or substance abuse diagnostic investigation and evaluation. The facility conducting the investigation and evaluation shall make a written report to the court stating its findings and recommendations including family-based services or treatment when appropriate. If its findings and recommendations support treatment, it shall also recommend a treatment plan setting out: Type of treatment; Nature of treatment; Length of treatment; A treatment time schedule; and Approximate cost of the treatment. The affected person shall be included in developing the appropriate treatment plan. The treatment plan must be signed by the treatment provider and the affected person. The initial written progress report based on the treatment plan shall be sent to the appropriate persons six weeks after initiation of treatment. Subsequent progress reports shall be provided after three months, six months, twelve months, and thereafter every six months if treatment exceeds twelve months. Reports are to be filed with the court in a timely manner. Close-out of the treatment record must include summary of pretreatment and posttreatment, with final outcome and disposition. The report shall also include recommendations for ongoing stability and decrease in destructive behavior. Each report shall also be filed with the court and a copy given to the person evaluated and the person's counsel. A copy of the treatment plan shall also be given to the department's  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY'S  caseworker and to the guardian ad litem. Any program for chemical dependency shall meet the program requirements contained in chapter 70.96A RCW. If the court has ordered treatment pursuant to a dependency proceeding it shall also require the treatment program to provide, in the reports required by subsection (2) of this section, status reports to the court, the department, the supervising  child-placing  agency  if any  , and the person or person's counsel regarding the person's cooperation with the treatment plan proposed and the person's progress in treatment. If a person subject to this section fails or neglects to carry out and fulfill any term or condition of the treatment plan, the program or agency administering the treatment shall report such breach to the court, the department, the guardian ad litem, the supervising  child-placing  agency if any, and the person or person's counsel, within twenty-four hours, together with its recommendation. These reports shall be made as a declaration by the person who is personally responsible for providing the treatment. Nothing in this chapter may be construed as allowing the court to require the department to pay for the cost of any alcohol or substance abuse evaluation or treatment program. RCW 13.34.176 and 2000 c 122 s 24 are each amended to read as follows: The court, upon receiving a report under RCW 13.34.174(4) or at the  department's   SUPERVISING AGENCY'S  request, may schedule a show cause hearing to determine whether the person is in violation of the treatment conditions. All parties shall be given notice of the hearing. The court shall hold the hearing within ten days of the request for a hearing. At the hearing, testimony, declarations, reports, or other relevant information may be presented on the person's alleged failure to comply with the treatment plan and the person shall have the right to present similar information on his or her own behalf. If the court finds that there has been a violation of the treatment conditions it shall modify the dependency order, as necessary, to ensure the safety of the child. The modified order shall remain in effect until the party is in full compliance with the treatment requirements. RCW 13.34.180 and 2001 c 332 s 4 are each amended to read as follows: A petition seeking termination of a parent and child relationship may be filed in juvenile court by any party  , INCLUDING THE SUPERVISING AGENCY,  to the dependency proceedings concerning that child. Such petition shall conform to the requirements of RCW 13.34.040, shall be served upon the parties as provided in RCW 13.34.070(8), and shall allege all of the following unless subsection (2) or (3) of this section applies: That the child has been found to be a dependent child; That the court has entered a dispositional order pursuant to RCW 13.34.130; That the child has been removed or will, at the time of the hearing, have been removed from the custody of the parent for a period of at least six months pursuant to a finding of dependency; That the services ordered under RCW 13.34.136 have been expressly and understandably offered or provided and all necessary services, reasonably available, capable of correcting the parental deficiencies within the foreseeable future have been expressly and understandably offered or provided; That there is little likelihood that conditions will be remedied so that the child can be returned to the parent in the near future. A parent's failure to substantially improve parental deficiencies within twelve months following entry of the dispositional order shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that there is little likelihood that conditions will be remedied so that the child can be returned to the parent in the near future. The presumption shall not arise unless the petitioner makes a showing that all necessary services reasonably capable of correcting the parental deficiencies within the foreseeable future have been clearly offered or provided. In determining whether the conditions will be remedied the court may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: Use of intoxicating or controlled substances so as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child for extended periods of time or for periods of time that present a risk of imminent harm to the child, and documented unwillingness of the parent to receive and complete treatment or documented multiple failed treatment attempts; or Psychological incapacity or mental deficiency of the parent that is so severe and chronic as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child for extended periods of time or for periods of time that present a risk of imminent harm to the child, and documented unwillingness of the parent to receive and complete treatment or documentation that there is no treatment that can render the parent capable of providing proper care for the child in the near future; and That continuation of the parent and child relationship clearly diminishes the child's prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent home. In lieu of the allegations in subsection (1) of this section, the petition may allege that the child was found under such circumstances that the whereabouts of the child's parent are unknown and no person has acknowledged paternity or maternity and requested custody of the child within two months after the child was found. In lieu of the allegations in subsection (1)(b) through (f) of this section, the petition may allege that the parent has been convicted of: Murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, or homicide by abuse as defined in chapter 9A.32 RCW against another child of the parent; Manslaughter in the first degree or manslaughter in the second degree, as defined in chapter 9A.32 RCW against another child of the parent; Attempting, conspiring, or soliciting another to commit one or more of the crimes listed in (a) or (b) of this subsection; or Assault in the first or second degree, as defined in chapter 9A.36 RCW, against the surviving child or another child of the parent. Notice of rights shall be served upon the parent, guardian, or legal custodian with the petition and shall be in substantially the following form:                                    ""NOTICE A petition for termination of parental rights has been filed against you. You have important legal rights and you must take steps to protect your interests. This petition could result in permanent loss of your parental rights. You have the right to a fact-finding hearing before a judge. You have the right to have a lawyer represent you at the hearing.

RCW 13.34.210 and 2003 c 227 s 8 are each amended to read as follows: If, upon entering an order terminating the parental rights of a parent, there remains no parent having parental rights, the court shall commit the child to the custody of  the department or to  a  licensed child-placing   SUPERVISING  agency willing to accept custody for the purpose of placing the child for adoption. If an adoptive home has not been identified, the  department or   SUPERVISING  agency shall place the child in a licensed foster home, or take other suitable measures for the care and welfare of the child. The custodian shall have authority to consent to the adoption of the child consistent with chapter 26.33 RCW, the marriage of the child, the enlistment of the child in the armed forces of the United States, necessary surgical and other medical treatment for the child, and to consent to such other matters as might normally be required of the parent of the child. If a child has not been adopted within six months after the date of the order and a guardianship of the child under RCW 13.34.231 or chapter 11.88 RCW, or a permanent custody order under chapter 26.10 RCW, has not been entered by the court, the court shall review the case every six months until a decree of adoption is entered except for those cases which are reviewed by a citizen review board under chapter 13.70 RCW. The supervising agency shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the child maintains relationships with siblings as provided in RCW 13.34.130(3) and shall report to the court the status and extent of such relationships. RCW 13.34.215 and 2008 c 267 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: A child may petition the juvenile court to reinstate the previously terminated parental rights of his or her parent under the following circumstances: The child was previously found to be a dependent child under this chapter; The child's parent's rights were terminated in a proceeding under this chapter; The child has not achieved his or her permanency plan within three years of a final order of termination; and The child must be at least twelve years old at the time the petition is filed. Upon the child's motion for good cause shown, or on its own motion, the court may hear a petition filed by a child younger than twelve years old. A child seeking to petition under this section shall be provided counsel at no cost to the child. The petition must be signed by the child in the absence of a showing of good cause as to why the child could not do so. If, after a threshold hearing to consider the parent's apparent fitness and interest in reinstatement of parental rights, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the best interests of the child may be served by reinstatement of parental rights, the juvenile court shall order that a hearing on the merits of the petition be held. The court shall give prior notice for any proceeding under this section, or cause prior notice to be given, to the department  OR THE SUPERVISING AGENCY  , the child's attorney, and the child. The court shall also order the department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  to give prior notice of any hearing to the child's former parent whose parental rights are the subject of the petition, any parent whose rights have not been terminated, the child's current foster parent, relative caregiver, guardian or custodian, and the child's tribe, if applicable. The juvenile court shall conditionally grant the petition if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child has not achieved his or her permanency plan and is not likely to imminently achieve his or her permanency plan and that reinstatement of parental rights is in the child's best interest. In determining whether reinstatement is in the child's best interest the court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following: Whether the parent whose rights are to be reinstated is a fit parent and has remedied his or her deficits as provided in the record of the prior termination proceedings and prior termination order; The age and maturity of the child, and the ability of the child to express his or her preference; Whether the reinstatement of parental rights will present a risk to the child's health, welfare, or safety; and Other material changes in circumstances, if any, that may have occurred which warrant the granting of the petition. In determining whether the child has or has not achieved his or her permanency plan or whether the child is likely to achieve his or her permanency plan, the department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall provide the court, and the court shall review, information related to any efforts to achieve the permanency plan including efforts to achieve adoption or a permanent guardianship. If the court conditionally grants the petition under subsection (6) of this section, the case will be continued for six months and a temporary order of reinstatement entered. During this period, the child shall be placed in the custody of the parent. The department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall develop a permanency plan for the child reflecting the plan to be reunification and shall provide transition services to the family as appropriate. If the child must be removed from the parent due to abuse or neglect allegations prior to the expiration of the conditional six-month period, the court shall dismiss the petition for reinstatement of parental rights if the court finds the allegations have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. If the child has been successfully placed with the parent for six months, the court order reinstating parental rights remains in effect and the court shall dismiss the dependency. After the child has been placed with the parent for six months, the court shall hold a hearing. If the placement with the parent has been successful, the court shall enter a final order of reinstatement of parental rights, which shall restore all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations of the parent as to the child, including those relating to custody, control, and support of the child. The court shall dismiss the dependency and direct the clerk's office to provide a certified copy of the final order of reinstatement of parental rights to the parent at no cost. The granting of the petition under this section does not vacate or otherwise affect the validity of the original termination order. Any parent whose rights are reinstated under this section shall not be liable for any child support owed to the department pursuant to RCW 13.34.160 or Title 26 RCW or costs of other services provided to a child for the time period from the date of termination of parental rights to the date parental rights are reinstated. A proceeding to reinstate parental rights is a separate action from the termination of parental rights proceeding and does not vacate the original termination of parental rights. An order granted under this section reinstates the parental rights to the child. This reinstatement is a recognition that the situation of the parent and child have changed since the time of the termination of parental rights and reunification is now appropriate. This section is retroactive and applies to any child who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court at the time of the hearing regardless of the date parental rights were terminated. The state, the department,  THE SUPERVISING AGENCY,  and its employees are not liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in the provision of services under this section, unless the act or omission constitutes gross negligence. This section does not create any duty and shall not be construed to create a duty where none exists. This section does not create a cause of action against the state, the department,  THE SUPERVISING AGENCY,  or its employees concerning the original termination. RCW 13.34.230 and 1981 c 195 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: Any party to a dependency proceeding, including the supervising agency, may file a petition in juvenile court requesting that guardianship be created as to a dependent child. The department  of social and health services   OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall receive notice of any guardianship proceedings and have the right to intervene in the proceedings. RCW 13.34.233 and 2000 c 122 s 30 are each amended to read as follows: Any party may request the court under RCW 13.34.150 to modify or terminate a dependency guardianship order. Notice of any motion to modify or terminate the guardianship shall be served on all other parties, including any agency that was responsible for supervising the child's placement at the time the guardianship petition was filed. Notice in all cases shall be served upon the department. If the department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  was not previously a party to the guardianship proceeding, the department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall nevertheless have the right to: (a) Initiate a proceeding to modify or terminate a guardianship; and (b) intervene at any stage of such a proceeding. The guardianship may be modified or terminated upon the motion of any party  or   ,  the department  , OR THE SUPERVISING AGENCY  if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a substantial change of circumstances subsequent to the establishment of the guardianship and that it is in the child's best interest to modify or terminate the guardianship. The court shall hold a hearing on the motion before modifying or terminating a guardianship. Upon entry of an order terminating the guardianship, the dependency guardian shall not have any rights or responsibilities with respect to the child and shall not have legal standing to participate as a party in further dependency proceedings pertaining to the child. The court may allow the child's dependency guardian to attend dependency review proceedings pertaining to the child for the sole purpose of providing information about the child to the court. Upon entry of an order terminating the guardianship, the child shall remain dependent and the court shall either return the child to the child's parent or order the child into the custody, control, and care of  the department or  a  licensed child-placing   SUPERVISING  agency for placement in a foster home or group care facility licensed pursuant to chapter 74.15 RCW or in a home not required to be licensed pursuant to such chapter. The court shall not place a child in the custody of the child's parent unless the court finds that reasons for removal as set forth in RCW 13.34.130 no longer exist and that such placement is in the child's best interest. The court shall thereafter conduct reviews as provided in RCW 13.34.138 and, where applicable, shall hold a permanency planning hearing in accordance with RCW 13.34.145. RCW 13.34.245 and 1997 c 386 s 18 are each amended to read as follows: Where any parent or Indian custodian voluntarily consents to foster care placement of an Indian child and a petition for dependency has not been filed regarding the child, such consent shall not be valid unless executed in writing before the court and filed with the court. The consent shall be accompanied by the written certification of the court that the terms and consequences of the consent were fully explained in detail to the parent or Indian custodian during the court proceeding and were fully understood by the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall also certify in writing either that the parent or Indian custodian fully understood the explanation in English or that it was interpreted into a language that the parent or Indian custodian understood. Any consent given prior to, or within ten days after, the birth of the Indian child shall not be valid. To obtain court validation of a voluntary consent to foster care placement, any person may file a petition for validation alleging that there is located or residing within the county an Indian child whose parent or Indian custodian wishes to voluntarily consent to foster care placement of the child and requesting that the court validate the consent as provided in this section. The petition shall contain the name, date of birth, and residence of the child, the names and residences of the consenting parent or Indian custodian, and the name and location of the Indian tribe in which the child is a member or eligible for membership. The petition shall state whether the placement preferences of 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1915 (b) or (c) will be followed. Reasonable attempts shall be made by the petitioner to ascertain and set forth in the petition the identity, location, and custodial status of any parent or Indian custodian who has not consented to foster care placement and why that parent or Indian custodian cannot assume custody of the child. Upon filing of the petition for validation, the clerk of the court shall schedule the petition for a hearing on the court validation of the voluntary consent no later than forty-eight hours after the petition has been filed, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Notification of time, date, location, and purpose of the validation hearing shall be provided as soon as possible to the consenting parent or Indian custodian, the  department or other child-placing   SUPERVISING  agency which is to assume responsibility for the child's placement and care pursuant to the consent to foster care placement, and the Indian tribe in which the child is enrolled or eligible for enrollment as a member. If the identity and location of any nonconsenting parent or Indian custodian is known, reasonable attempts shall be made to notify the parent or Indian custodian of the consent to placement and the validation hearing. Notification under this subsection may be given by the most expedient means, including, but not limited to, mail, personal service, telephone, and telegraph. Any parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent to a voluntary foster care placement, made under this section, at any time. Unless the Indian child has been taken in custody pursuant to RCW 13.34.050 or 26.44.050, placed in shelter care pursuant to RCW 13.34.060, or placed in foster care pursuant to RCW 13.34.130, the Indian child shall be returned to the parent or Indian custodian upon withdrawal of consent to foster care placement of the child. Upon termination of the voluntary foster care placement and return of the child to the parent or Indian custodian, the department or  other child-placing   SUPERVISING  agency which had assumed responsibility for the child's placement and care pursuant to the consent to foster care placement shall file with the court written notification of the child's return and shall also send such notification to the Indian tribe in which the child is enrolled or eligible for enrollment as a member and to any other party to the validation proceeding including any noncustodial parent. RCW 13.34.320 and 1999 c 188 s 2 are each amended to read as follows: The  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall obtain the prior consent of a child's parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian before a dependent child is admitted into an inpatient mental health treatment facility. If the child's parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian is unavailable or does not agree with the proposed admission, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall request a hearing and provide notice to all interested parties to seek prior approval of the juvenile court before such admission. In the event that an emergent situation creating a risk of substantial harm to the health and welfare of a child in the custody of the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  does not allow time for the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  to obtain prior approval or to request a court hearing before consenting to the admission of the child into an inpatient mental health hospital, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall seek court approval by requesting that a hearing be set on the first available court date. RCW 13.34.330 and 1999 c 188 s 3 are each amended to read as follows: A dependent child who is admitted to an inpatient mental health facility shall be placed in a facility, with available treatment space, that is closest to the family home, unless the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  , in consultation with the admitting authority finds that admission in the facility closest to the child's home would jeopardize the health or safety of the child. RCW 13.34.340 and 2000 c 122 s 35 are each amended to read as follows: For minors who cannot consent to the release of their records with the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  because they are not old enough to consent to treatment, or, if old enough, lack the capacity to consent, or if the minor is receiving treatment involuntarily with a provider the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  has authorized to provide mental health treatment under RCW 13.34.320, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall disclose, upon the treating physician's request, all relevant records, including the minor's passport as established under RCW 74.13.285, in the  department's   SUPERVISING AGENCY'S  possession that the treating physician determines contain information required for treatment of the minor. The treating physician shall maintain all records received from the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  in a manner that distinguishes the records from any other records in the minor's file with the treating physician and the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  records may not be disclosed by the treating physician to any other person or entity absent a court order except that, for medical purposes only, a treating physician may disclose the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  records to another treating physician. RCW 13.34.350 and 2001 c 52 s 2 are each amended to read as follows: In order to facilitate communication of information needed to serve the best interest of any child who is the subject of a dependency case filed under this chapter, the department  of social and health services  shall, consistent with state and federal law governing the release of confidential information, establish guidelines, and shall use those guidelines for the facilitation of communication of relevant information among divisions, providers, the courts, the family, caregivers, caseworkers, and others. RCW 13.34.370 and 2004 c 146 s 2 are each amended to read as follows: The court may order expert evaluations of parties to obtain information regarding visitation issues or other issues in a case. These evaluations shall be performed by appointed evaluators who are mutually agreed upon by the court, the  state   SUPERVISING AGENCY  , and the parents' counsel, and, if the child is to be evaluated, by the representative for the child. If no agreement can be reached, the court shall select the expert evaluator. RCW 13.34.380 and 2004 c 146 s 3 are each amended to read as follows: The department  of social and health services  shall develop consistent policies and protocols, based on current relevant research, concerning visitation for dependent children to be implemented consistently throughout the state. The department shall develop the policies and protocols in consultation with researchers in the field, community-based agencies, court-appointed special advocates, parents' representatives, and court representatives. The policies and protocols shall include, but not be limited to: The structure and quality of visitations; and training for  DEPARTMENT AND SUPERVISING AGENCY  caseworkers, visitation supervisors, and foster parents related to visitation. The policies and protocols shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter and implementation of the policies and protocols shall be consistent with relevant orders of the court. RCW 13.34.385 and 2008 c 259 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: A relative of a dependent child may petition the juvenile court for reasonable visitation with the child if: The child has been found to be a dependent child under this chapter; The parental rights of both of the child's parents have been terminated; The child is in the custody of the department or another public  or private  agency  OR A SUPERVISING AGENCY  ; and The child has not been adopted and is not in a preadoptive home or other permanent placement at the time the petition for visitation is filed. The court shall give prior notice for any proceeding under this section, or cause prior notice to be given, to the department or public  or private  agency  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  having custody of the child, the child's attorney or guardian ad litem if applicable, and the child. The court shall also order the custodial agency to give prior notice of any hearing to the child's current foster parent, relative caregiver, guardian or custodian, and the child's tribe, if applicable. The juvenile court may grant the petition for visitation if it finds that the requirements of subsection (1) of this section have been met, and that unsupervised visitation between the child and the relative does not present a risk to the child's safety or well-being and that the visitation is in the best interests of the child. In determining the best interests of the child the court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following: The love, affection, and strength of the relationship between the child and the relative; The length and quality of the prior relationship between the child and the relative; Any criminal convictions for or founded history of abuse or neglect of a child by the relative; Whether the visitation will present a risk to the child's health, welfare, or safety; The child's reasonable preference, if the court considers the child to be of sufficient age to express a preference; Any other factor relevant to the child's best interest. The visitation order may be modified at any time upon a showing that the visitation poses a risk to the child's safety or well-being. The visitation order shall state that visitation will automatically terminate upon the child's placement in a preadoptive home, if the child is adopted, or if there is a subsequent founded abuse or neglect allegation against the relative. The granting of the petition under this section does not grant the relative the right to participate in the dependency action and does not grant any rights to the relative not otherwise specified in the visitation order. This section is retroactive and applies to any eligible dependent child at the time of the filing of the petition for visitation, regardless of the date parental rights were terminated. For the purpose of this section, ""relative"" means a relative as defined in RCW 74.15.020(2)(a), except parents. This section is intended to provide an additional procedure by which a relative may request visitation with a dependent child. It is not intended to impair or alter the ability a court currently has to order visitation with a relative under the dependency statutes. RCW 13.34.390 and 2005 c 504 s 303 are each amended to read as follows: The department  of social and health services  and the department of health shall develop and expand comprehensive services for drug-affected and alcohol-affected mothers and infants. Subject to funds appropriated for this purpose, the expansion shall be in evidence-based, research-based, or consensus-based practices,  as those terms are defined in section 603 of this act,  and shall expand capacity in underserved regions of the state. RCW 13.34.400 and 2007 c 411 s 2 are each amended to read as follows: In any proceeding under this chapter, if the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  submits a report to the court in which the department is recommending a new placement or a change in placement, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall include the documents relevant to persons in the home in which a child will be placed and listed in subsections (1) through (5) of this section to the report. The  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall include only these relevant documents and shall not attach the entire history of the subject of the report. If the report contains a recommendation, opinion, or assertion by the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  relating to substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment, anger management classes, or domestic violence classes, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall attach the document upon which the recommendation, opinion, or assertion was based. The documentation may include the progress report or evaluation submitted by the provider, but may not include the entire history with the provider. If the report contains a recommendation, opinion, or assertion by the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  relating to visitation with a child, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall attach the document upon which the recommendation, opinion, or assertion was based. The documentation may include the most recent visitation report, a visitation report referencing a specific incident alleged in the report, or summary of the visitation prepared by the person who supervised the visitation. The documentation attached to the report shall not include the entire visitation history. If the report contains a recommendation, opinion, or assertion by the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  relating to the psychological status of a person, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall attach the document upon which the recommendation, opinion, or assertion was based. The documentation may include the progress report, evaluation, or summary submitted by the provider, but shall not include the entire history of the person. If the report contains a recommendation, opinion, or assertion by the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  relating to injuries to a child, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall attach a summary of the physician's report, prepared by the physician or the physician's designee, relating to the recommendation, opinion, or assertion by the department. If the report contains a recommendation, opinion, or assertion by the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  relating to a home study, licensing action, or background check information, the  department   SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall attach the document or documents upon which that recommendation, opinion, or assertion is based. RCW 41.06.142 and 2008 c 267 s 9 are each amended to read as follows: Any department, agency, or institution of higher education may purchase services, including services that have been customarily and historically provided by employees in the classified service under this chapter, by contracting with individuals, nonprofit organizations, businesses, employee business units, or other entities if the following criteria are met: The invitation for bid or request for proposal contains measurable standards for the performance of the contract; Employees in the classified service whose positions or work would be displaced by the contract are provided an opportunity to offer alternatives to purchasing services by contract and, if these alternatives are not accepted, compete for the contract under competitive contracting procedures in subsection (4) of this section; The contract with an entity other than an employee business unit includes a provision requiring the entity to consider employment of state employees who may be displaced by the contract; The department, agency, or institution of higher education has established a contract monitoring process to measure contract performance, costs, service delivery quality, and other contract standards, and to cancel contracts that do not meet those standards; and The department, agency, or institution of higher education has determined that the contract results in savings or efficiency improvements.

Disbursements from the appropriations available from the general fund shall be made pursuant to such rules and regulations and pursuant to agreements conforming thereto to be made by the secretary with parents for the purpose of supporting the adoption of children in, or likely to be placed in, foster homes or child caring institutions who are found by the secretary to be difficult to place in adoption because of physical or other reasons; including, but not limited to, physical or mental handicap, emotional disturbance, ethnic background, language, race, color, age, or sibling grouping. Such agreements shall meet the following criteria: The child whose adoption is to be supported pursuant to such agreement shall be or have been a child hard to place in adoption. Such agreement must relate to a child who was or is residing in a foster home or child-caring institution or a child who, in the judgment of the secretary, is both eligible for, and likely to be placed in, either a foster home or a child-caring institution. Such agreement shall provide that adoption support shall not continue beyond the time that the adopted child reaches eighteen years of age, becomes emancipated, dies, or otherwise ceases to need support  , provided that   . I  f the secretary  shall  find  S  that continuing dependency of such child after such child reaches eighteen years of age warrants the continuation of support pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  the secretary may do so, subject to all the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  , including annual review of the amount of such support. Any prospective parent who is to be a party to such agreement shall be a person who has the character, judgment, sense of responsibility, and disposition which make him or her suitable as an adoptive parent of such child. RCW 74.13.124 and 1985 c 7 s 140 are each amended to read as follows: An agreement for adoption support made  pursuant to RCW 26.32.115  before January 1, 1985, or  PURSUANT TO  RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  , although subject to review and adjustment as provided for herein, shall, as to the standard used by the secretary in making such review or reviews and any such adjustment, constitutes a contract within the meaning of section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution and section 23, Article I of the state Constitution. For that reason once such an agreement has been made any review of and adjustment under such agreement shall as to the standards used by the secretary, be made only subject to the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  and such rules and regulations relating thereto as they exist on the date of the initial determination in connection with such agreement or such more generous standard or parts of such standard as may hereafter be provided for by law or regulation. Once made such an agreement shall constitute a solemn undertaking by the state of Washington with such adoptive parent or parents. The termination of the effective period of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  or a decision by the state or federal government to discontinue or reduce general appropriations made available for the purposes to be served by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  , shall not affect the state's specific continuing obligations to support such adoptions, subject to such annual review and adjustment for all such agreements as have theretofore been entered into by the state. The purpose of this section is to assure any such parent that, upon his  OR HER  consenting to assume the burdens of adopting a hard to place child, the state will not in future so act by way of general reduction of appropriations for the program authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  or ratable reductions, to impair the trust and confidence necessarily reposed by such parent in the state as a condition of such parent taking upon himself  OR HERSELF  the obligations of parenthood of a difficult to place child. Should the secretary and any such adoptive parent differ as to whether any standard or part of a standard adopted by the secretary after the date of an initial agreement, which standard or part is used by the secretary in making any review and adjustment, is more generous than the standard in effect as of the date of the initial determination with respect to such agreement such adoptive parent may invoke his  OR HER  rights, including all rights of appeal under the fair hearing provisions, available to him  OR HER  under RCW 74.13.127  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  . RCW 74.13.136 and 1985 c 7 s 144 are each amended to read as follows: Any  child-caring   SUPERVISING  agency or person having a child in foster care or institutional care and wishing to recommend to the secretary support of the adoption of such child as provided for in RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  may do so, and may include in its or his  OR HER  recommendation advice as to the appropriate level of support and any other information likely to assist the secretary in carrying out the functions vested in the secretary by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145  (AS RECODIFIED BY THIS ACT)  .

Preservice training shall assist applicants in making informed decisions about whether they want to be foster parents. Preservice training shall be designed to enable the agency to assess the ability, readiness, and appropriateness of families to be foster parents. As a decision tool, effective preservice training provides potential foster parents with enough information to make an appropriate decision, affords potential foster parents an opportunity to discuss their decision with others and consider its implications for their family, clarifies foster family expectations, presents a realistic picture of what foster parenting involves, and allows potential foster parents to consider and explore the different types of children they might serve.  FOSTER PARENTS SHALL COMPLETE P  reservice training  shall be completed prior to   BEFORE  the issuance of a foster care license, except that the department may, on a case by case basis, issue a written waiver that allows the foster parent to complete the training after licensure, so long as the training is completed within ninety days following licensure.

RCW 74.13.300 and 1990 c 284 s 12 are each amended to read as follows: Whenever a child has been placed in a foster family home by the  department or a child-placing   SUPERVISING  agency and the child has thereafter resided in the home for at least ninety consecutive days, the  department or child-placing   SUPERVISING  agency shall notify the foster family at least five days prior to moving the child to another placement, unless: A court order has been entered requiring an immediate change in placement; The child is being returned home; The child's safety is in jeopardy; or The child is residing in a receiving home or a group home.

RCW 74.13.310 and 1990 c 284 s 13 are each amended to read as follows: Adequate foster parent training has been identified as directly associated with increasing the length of time foster parents are willing to provide foster care and reducing the number of placement disruptions for children. Placement disruptions can be harmful to children by denying them consistent and nurturing support.

Foster parents who care for more demanding children, such as children with severe emotional, mental, or physical handicaps, would especially benefit from additional training. The department  AND SUPERVISING AGENCY  shall develop additional training for foster parents that focuses on skills to assist foster parents in caring for emotionally, mentally, or physically handicapped children. RCW 74.13.315 and 1997 c 272 s 6 are each amended to read as follows: The department  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY  may provide child care for all foster parents who are required to attend department-sponsored  OR SUPERVISING AGENCY-SPONSORED  meetings or training sessions.

This situation has caused a dangerously critical shortage of foster homes.   The department of social and health services shall develop and implement a project to recruit more foster homes and adoptive homes for special needs children by developing a request for proposal to licensed private foster care, licensed adoption agencies, and other organizations qualified to provide this service.   The project shall consist of one statewide administrator of recruitment programs, and one or more licensed foster care or adoption agency contracts in each of the six departmental regions. These contracts shall enhance currently provided services and may not replace services currently funded by the agencies. No more than sixty thousand dollars may be spent annually to fund the administrator position.
