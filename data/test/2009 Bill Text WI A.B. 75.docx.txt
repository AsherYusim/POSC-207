(2)  AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATION BONDS. (a) A common council shall have all powers necessary and convenient to carry out its duties, and to exercise its authority, under this section. (b)  Subject to pars. (c) and (d), a common council may issue appropriation bonds under this section to pay all or any part of the city's unfunded prior service liability with respect to an employee retirement system of the city, or to fund or refund outstanding appropriation bonds issued under this section. A city may use proceeds of appropriation bonds to pay issuance or administrative expenses, to make deposits to reserve funds, to pay accrued or funded interest, to pay the costs of credit enhancement, to make payments under other agreements entered into under s. 62.621, or to make deposits to stabilization funds established under s. 62.621. (c)  Other than refunding bonds issued under sub. (6), all bonds must be issued simultaneously. (d)   1.  Before a city may issue appropriation bonds under par.

The strategic and financial plan shall provide that future annual pension liabilities are funded on a current basis. The strategic and financial plan shall contain quantifiable benchmarks to measure compliance with the plan. The common council shall make a determination that the ordinance meets the requirements of this subdivision and, absent manifest error, the common council's determination shall be conclusive.

(a) A city may borrow moneys and issue appropriation bonds in evidence of the borrowing pursuant to one or more written authorizing resolutions under sub. (4). Unless otherwise provided in an authorizing resolution, the city may issue appropriation bonds at any time, in any specific amounts, at any rates of interest, for any term, payable at any intervals, at any place, in any manner, and having any other terms or conditions that the common council considers necessary or desirable. Appropriation bonds may bear interest at variable or fixed rates, bear no interest, or bear interest payable only at maturity or upon redemption prior to maturity. (b)  The common council may authorize appropriation bonds having any provisions for prepayment the common council considers necessary or desirable, including the payment of any premium.

(d)  All moneys borrowed by a city that is evidenced by appropriation bonds issued under this section shall be lawful money of the United States, and all appropriation bonds shall be payable in such money. (e)  All appropriation bonds owned or held by a fund of the city are outstanding in all respects, and the common council or other governing body controlling the fund shall have the same rights with respect to an appropriation bond as a private party, but if any sinking fund acquires appropriation bonds that gave rise to such fund, the appropriation bonds are considered paid for all purposes and no longer outstanding and shall be canceled as provided in sub. (7) (d). (f)  A city shall not be generally liable on appropriation bonds, and appropriation bonds shall not be a debt of the city for any purpose whatsoever. Appropriation bonds, including the principal thereof and interest thereon, shall be payable only from amounts that the common council may, from year to year, appropriate for the payment thereof. (4)  PROCEDURES. (a) No appropriation bonds may be issued by a city unless the issuance is pursuant to a written authorizing resolution adopted by a majority of a quorum of the common council. The resolution may be in the form of a resolution or trust indenture, and shall set forth the aggregate principal amount of appropriation bonds authorized thereby, the manner of their sale, and the form and terms thereof. The resolution or trust indenture may establish such funds and accounts, including a reserve fund, as the common council determines. (b)  Appropriation bonds may be sold at either public or private sale and may be sold at any price or percentage of par value. All appropriation bonds sold at public sale shall be noticed as provided in the authorizing resolution. Any bid received at public sale may be rejected. (5)  FORM.

(c)  Every appropriation bond shall be dated not later than the date it is issued, shall contain a reference by date to the appropriate authorizing resolution, shall state the limitation established in sub. (3) (f), and shall be in accordance with the appropriate authorizing resolution in all respects. (d)  An appropriation bond shall be substantially in such form and contain such statements or terms as determined by the common council, and may not conflict with law or with the appropriate authorizing resolution. (6)  REFUNDING BONDS. (a) 1. A common council may authorize the issuance of refunding appropriation bonds.  Refunding appropriation bonds may be issued, subject to any contract rights vested in owners of the appropriation bonds being refunded, to refund all or any part of one or more issues of appropriation bonds notwithstanding that the appropriation bonds may have been issued at different times or issues of general obligation promissory notes under s. 67.12 (12) were issued to pay unfunded prior service liability with respect to an employee retirement system.  The principal amount of the refunding appropriation bonds may not exceed the sum of: the principal amount of the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded; applicable redemption premiums; unpaid interest on the refunded appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes to the date of delivery or exchange of the refunding appropriation bonds; in the event the proceeds are to be deposited in trust as provided in par. (c), interest to accrue on the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes to be refunded from the date of delivery to the date of maturity or to the redemption date selected by the common council, whichever is earlier; and the expenses incurred in the issuance of the refunding appropriation bonds and the payment of the refunded appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes. 2.  A common council may authorize the issuance of general obligation promissory notes under s. 67.12 (12) (a) to refund appropriation bonds, notwithstanding s.  67.01 (9) (intro.). (b)  If a common council determines to exchange refunding appropriation bonds, they may be exchanged privately for, and in payment and discharge of, any of the outstanding appropriation bonds being refunded.  Refunding appropriation bonds may be exchanged for such principal amount of the appropriation bonds being exchanged therefor as may be determined by the common council to be necessary or desirable. The owners of the appropriation bonds being refunded who elect to exchange need not pay accrued interest on the refunding appropriation bonds if and to the extent that interest is accrued and unpaid on the appropriation bonds being refunded and to be surrendered. If any of the appropriation bonds to be refunded are to be called for redemption, the common council shall determine which redemption dates are to be used, if more than one date is applicable and shall, prior to the issuance of the refunding appropriation bonds, provide for notice of redemption to be given in the manner and at the times required by the resolution authorizing the appropriation bonds to be refunded. (c)   1.  The principal proceeds from the sale of any refunding appropriation bonds shall be applied either to the immediate payment and retirement of the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded or, if the bonds or general obligation promissory notes have not matured and are not presently redeemable, to the creation of a trust for, and shall be pledged to the payment of, the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded. 2.  If a trust is created, a separate deposit shall be made for each issue of appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded. Each deposit shall be with a bank or trust company authorized by the laws of the United States or of a state in which it is located to conduct banking or trust company business. If the total amount of any deposit, including moneys other than sale proceeds but legally available for such purpose, is less than the principal amount of the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded and for the payment of which the deposit has been created and pledged, together with applicable redemption premiums and interest accrued and to accrue to maturity or to the date of redemption, then the application of the sale proceeds shall be legally sufficient only if the moneys deposited are invested in securities issued by the United States or one of its agencies, or securities fully guaranteed by the United States, and only if the principal amount of the securities at maturity and the income therefrom to maturity will be sufficient and available, without the need for any further investment or reinvestment, to pay at maturity or upon redemption the principal amount of the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded together with applicable redemption premiums and interest accrued and to accrue to maturity or to the date of redemption. The income from the principal proceeds of the securities shall be applied solely to the payment of the principal of and interest and redemption premiums on the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded, but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any surplus. 3.  Nothing in this paragraph may be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded that have not matured and that are not presently redeemable. Nothing in this paragraph may be constructed to prohibit reinvestment of the income of a trust if the reinvestments will mature at such times that sufficient moneys will be available to pay interest, applicable premiums, and principal on the appropriation bonds or general obligation promissory notes being refunded. (7)  FISCAL REGULATIONS. (a) All appropriation bonds shall be registered by the city clerk or city treasurer of the city issuing the appropriation bonds, or such other officers or agents, including fiscal agents, as the common council may determine. After registration, no transfer of an appropriation bond is valid unless made by the registered owner's duly authorized attorney, on the records of the city and similarly noted on the appropriation bond.  The city may treat the registered owner as the owner of the appropriation bond for all purposes. Payments of principal and interest shall be by electronic funds transfer, check, share draft, or other draft to the registered owner at the owner's address as it appears on the register, unless the common council has otherwise provided.  Information in the register is not available for inspection and copying under s. 19.35 (1). The common council may make any other provision respecting registration as it considers necessary or desirable. (b)  The common council may appoint one or more trustees or fiscal agents for each issue of appropriation bonds. The city treasurer may be designated as the trustee and the sole fiscal agent or as cofiscal agent for any issue of appropriation bonds. Every other fiscal agent shall be an incorporated bank or trust company authorized by the laws of the United States or of the state in which it is located to conduct banking or trust company business.  There may be deposited with a trustee, in a special account, moneys to be used only for the purposes expressly provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of appropriation bonds or an agreement between the city and the trustee. The common council may make other provisions respecting trustees and fiscal agents as the common council considers necessary or desirable and may enter into contracts with any trustee or fiscal agent containing such terms, including compensation, and conditions in regard to the trustee or fiscal agent as the common council considers necessary or desirable. (c)  If any appropriation bond is destroyed, lost, or stolen, the city shall execute and deliver a new appropriation bond, upon filing with the common council evidence satisfactory to the common council that the appropriation bond has been destroyed, lost, or stolen, upon providing proof of ownership thereof, and upon furnishing the common council with indemnity satisfactory to it and complying with such other rules of the city and paying any expenses that the city may incur. The common council shall cancel the appropriation bond surrendered to the city. (d)  Unless otherwise directed by the common council, every appropriation bond paid or otherwise retired shall be marked ""canceled"" and delivered to the city treasurer, or to such other fiscal agent as applicable with respect to the appropriation bond, who shall destroy them and deliver a certificate to that effect to the city clerk.

The evidence shall include wage rate information reflecting work performed by persons working in the contested trade or occupation in the area during the current survey period. The department shall affirm or modify the initial determination within 15 days after the date on which the department receives the request for recalculation. (e)  In addition to the recalculation under par. (d), the owner or developer that requested the determination under this subsection may request a review of any portion of the determination within 30 days after the date of issuance of the determination if the owner or developer submits evidence with the request showing that the prevailing wage rate for any given trade or occupation included in the determination does not represent the prevailing wage rate for that trade or occupation in the city, village, or town in which the proposed publicly funded private construction project is located.

(2) (b) or has not notified a minor subcontractor of a determination in the manner prescribed by the department by rule promulgated under sub. (2) (b), the department shall notify the owner, developer, contractor, or subcontractor of the noncompliance and shall file the determination with the owner, developer, contractor, or subcontractor within 30 days after the notice.

An employer shall not be deemed to have refused to bargain until an election has been held and the results thereof certified to the employer by the commission.  The violation shall include, though not be limited thereby, to the refusal to execute a collective bargaining agreement previously agreed upon.

(1), 2 or more collective bargaining units described under sub. (1) (a) to (r) may be combined into a single unit. If 2 or more collective bargaining units seek to combine into a single collective bargaining unit, the commission shall, upon the petition of at least 30 percent of the employees in each unit, hold an election, or include on any ballot for an election held under s. 111.990 (2) the question of whether to combine units, to determine whether a majority of those employees voting in each unit desire to combine into a single unit. A combined collective bargaining unit shall be formed including all employees from each of those units in which a majority of the employees voting in the election approve a combined unit. The combined collective bargaining unit shall be formed immediately if there is no existing collective bargaining agreement in force in any of the units to be combined. If there is a collective bargaining agreement in force at the time of the election in any of the collective bargaining units to be combined, the combined unit shall be formed upon expiration of the last agreement for the units concerned. (b)  If 2 or more collective bargaining units have combined under par. (a), the commission shall, upon petition of at least 30 percent of the employees in any of the original units, hold an election of the employees in the original unit to determine whether the employees in that unit desire to withdraw from the combined collective bargaining unit. If a majority of the employees voting desire to withdraw from the combined collective bargaining unit, separate units consisting of the unit in which the election was held and a unit composed of the remainder of the combined unit shall be formed. The new collective bargaining units shall be formed immediately if there is no collective bargaining agreement in force for the combined unit. If there is a collective bargaining agreement in force for the combined collective bargaining unit, the new units shall be formed upon the expiration of the agreement. While there is a collective bargaining agreement in force for the combined collective bargaining unit, a petition for an election under this paragraph may be filed only during October in the calendar year prior to the expiration of the agreement.  (3) The commission shall assign employees to the appropriate collective bargaining units described under sub. (1) or (2) or under s. 111.825 (1) or (2).  (4)  Any labor organization may petition for recognition as the exclusive representative of a collective bargaining unit described under sub. (1) or (2) in accordance with the election procedures under s. 111.990 if the petition is accompanied by a 30 percent showing of interest in the form of signed authorization cards. Any additional labor organization seeking to appear on the ballot shall file a petition within 60 days of the date of filing of the original petition and prove, through signed authorization cards, that at least 10 percent of the employees in the collective bargaining unit want it to be their representative. (5)  Although academic staff supervisors are not considered employees for the purpose of this subchapter, the commission may consider a petition for a statewide collective bargaining unit consisting of academic staff supervisors, but the representative of the supervisors may not be affiliated with any labor organization representing employees. For purposes of this subsection, affiliation does not include membership in a national, state, county, or municipal federation of national or international labor organizations. The certified representative of the supervisors may not bargain collectively with respect to any matter other than wages and fringe benefits. 111.990 Representatives and elections.   (1)  A representative chosen for the purposes of collective bargaining by a majority of the employees voting in a collective bargaining unit shall be the exclusive representative of all of the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining. Any individual employee, or any minority group of employees in any collective bargaining unit, may present any grievance to the employer in person, or through representatives of their own choosing, and the employer shall confer with the individual employee or group of employees with respect to the grievance if the majority representative has been afforded the opportunity to be present at the conference. Any adjustment resulting from such a conference may not be inconsistent with the conditions of employment established by the majority representative and the employer. (2)   (a)  Whenever a question arises concerning the representation of employees in a collective bargaining unit, the commission shall determine the representation by taking a secret ballot of the employees and certifying in writing the results to the interested parties and to the board. There shall be included on any ballot for the election of representatives the names of all labor organizations having an interest in representing the employees participating in the election as indicated in petitions filed with the commission. The name of any existing representative shall be included on the ballot without the necessity of filing a petition. The commission may exclude from the ballot one who, at the time of the election, stands deprived of his or her rights under this subchapter by reason of a prior adjudication of his or her having engaged in an unfair labor practice. The ballot shall be so prepared as to permit a vote against representation by anyone named on the ballot. (b)   1.  Except as provided in subd. 2., for elections in a collective bargaining unit composed of employees who are members of the faculty or academic staff, whenever more than one representative qualifies to appear on the ballot, the ballot shall be so prepared as to provide separate votes on 2 questions. The first question shall be:     ""Shall the employees of the … (name of collective bargaining unit) participate in collective bargaining?"". The 2nd question shall be: ""If the employees of the … (name of collective bargaining unit) elect to participate in collective bargaining, which labor organization do you favor to act as representative of the employees?"". The 2nd question shall not include a choice for no representative. All employees in the collective bargaining unit may vote on both questions. Unless a majority of those employees voting in the election vote to participate in collective bargaining, no votes for a particular representative may be counted. If a majority of those employees voting in the election vote to participate in collective bargaining, the ballots for representatives shall be counted. 2.  For elections in a collective bargaining unit composed of employees who are members of the faculty or academic staff, whenever more than one representative qualifies to appear on the ballot and a question of whether to combine collective bargaining units as permitted under s. 111.98 (2) (a) qualifies to appear on the ballot, the ballot shall be so prepared as to provide separate votes on 3 questions and each ballot shall identify the collective bargaining unit to which each voter currently belongs. The first question shall be: ""Shall the employees of the …  (name of the voter's current collective bargaining unit) participate in collective bargaining?"". The 2nd question shall be ""Shall the employees of the … (names of all of the collective bargaining units that qualify to appear on the ballot, including the name of the voter's current collective bargaining unit) combine to participate in collective bargaining?"". The 3rd question shall be: ""If the employees of the … (name of the voter's current collective bargaining unit) elect to participate in collective bargaining, which labor organization do you favor to act as representative of the employees?"". The 3rd question shall not include a choice for no representative. All employees in the collective bargaining unit may vote on all questions. Unless a majority of those employees voting in the election vote to participate in collective bargaining, no votes for combination or for a particular representative may be counted. If a majority of those employees voting in the election vote to participate in collective bargaining, the ballots for combination shall be counted. If the ballots for combination are counted and a majority of those employees voting from each collective bargaining unit listed in the 2nd question on the ballot vote to combine, then the ballots for representatives of the combined collective bargaining unit shall be counted. If the ballots for combination are counted and a majority of those employees voting from each collective bargaining unit listed in the 2nd question on the ballot do not vote to combine, then the ballots for representatives of each current collective bargaining unit shall be counted. (c)  The commission's certification of the results of any election is conclusive as to the findings included therein unless reviewed under s. 111.07 (8). (3)  Whenever an election has been conducted under sub. (2) in which the ballots for representatives have been counted but in which no named representative is favored by a majority of the employees voting, the commission may, if requested by a party to the proceeding within 30 days from the date of the certification of the results of the election, conduct a runoff election. In that runoff election, the commission shall drop from the ballot the name of the representative who received the least number of votes at the original election. (4)  While a collective bargaining agreement between a labor organization and an employer is in force under this subchapter, a petition for an election in the collective bargaining unit to which the agreement applies may be filed only during October in the calendar year prior to the expiration of that agreement. An election held under that petition may be held only if the petition is supported by proof that at least 30 percent of the employees in the collective bargaining unit desire a change or discontinuance of existing representation. Within 60 days of the time that an original petition is filed, another petition may be filed supported by proof that at least 10 percent of the employees in the same collective bargaining unit desire a different representative. If a majority of the employees in the collective bargaining unit vote for a change or discontinuance of representation by any named representative, the decision takes effect upon expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the existing representative. 111.991  Unfair labor practices. (1) It is an unfair labor practice for an employer individually or in concert with others: (a)  To interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed under s. 111.97. (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, to initiate, create, dominate, or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor or employee organization or contribute financial support to it. Except as provided in ss. 40.02 (22) (e) and 40.23 (1) (f) 4., no change in any law affecting the Wisconsin Retirement System under ch. 40 and no action by the employer that is authorized by such a law is a violation of this paragraph unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement specifically prohibits the change or action. No such change or action affects the continuing duty to bargain collectively regarding the Wisconsin Retirement System under ch. 40 to the extent required by s. 111.998. It is not an unfair labor practice for the employer to reimburse an employee at his or her prevailing wage rate for the time spent during the employee's regularly scheduled hours conferring with the employer's officers or agents and for attendance at commission or court hearings necessary for the administration of this subchapter. (c)  To encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in regard to hiring, tenure, or other terms or conditions of employment. This paragraph does not apply to fair-share or maintenance of membership agreements. (d)  To refuse to bargain collectively on matters set forth in s. 111.998 with a representative of a majority of its employees in an appropriate collective bargaining unit. Whenever the employer has a good faith doubt as to whether a labor organization claiming the support of a majority of its employees in an appropriate collective bargaining unit does in fact have that support, it may file with the commission a petition requesting an election as to that claim. The employer is not considered to have refused to bargain until an election has been held and the results of the election are certified to the employer by the commission. A violation of this paragraph includes the refusal to execute a collective bargaining agreement previously orally agreed upon. (e)  To violate any collective bargaining agreement previously agreed upon by the parties with respect to wages, hours, and conditions of employment affecting the employees, including an agreement to arbitrate or to accept the terms of an arbitration award, when previously the parties have agreed to accept such award as final and binding upon them. (f)  To deduct labor organization dues from an employee's earnings, unless the employer has been presented with an individual order therefor, signed by the employee personally, and terminable by at least the end of any year of its life or earlier by the employee giving at least 30 but not more than 120 days' written notice of such termination to the employer and to the representative labor organization, except if there is a fair-share or maintenance of membership agreement in effect. The employer shall give notice to the labor organization of receipt of such notice of termination. (1m) Notwithstanding sub.   (1)  , it is not an unfair labor practice for the board to implement changes in salaries or conditions of employment for members of the faculty or academic staff at one institution, and not for other members of the faculty or academic staff at another institution, but this may be done only if the differential treatment is based on comparisons with the compensation and working conditions of employees performing similar services for comparable higher education institutions or based upon other competitive factors. (2)  It is unfair practice for an employee individually or in concert with others: (a)  To coerce or intimidate an employee in the enjoyment of the employee's legal rights, including those guaranteed under s. 111.97. (b)  To coerce, intimidate, or induce any officer or agent of the employer to interfere with any of the employer's employees in the enjoyment of their legal rights including those guaranteed under s. 111.97 or to engage in any practice with regard to its employees which would constitute an unfair labor practice if undertaken by the officer or agent on the officer's or agent's own initiative. (c)  To refuse to bargain collectively on matters specified in s. 111.998 with the authorized officer or agent of the employer that is the recognized or certified exclusive collective bargaining representative of employees in an appropriate collective bargaining unit. Such refusal to bargain shall include a refusal to execute a collective bargaining agreement previously orally agreed upon. (d)  To violate the provisions of any written agreement with respect to terms and conditions of employment affecting employees, including an agreement to arbitrate or to accept the terms of an arbitration award, when previously the parties have agreed to accept such awards as final and binding upon them. (e)  To engage in, induce, or encourage any employees to engage in a strike or a concerted refusal to work or perform their usual duties as employees. (f)  To coerce or intimidate a supervisory employee, officer, or agent of the employer, working at the same trade or profession as the employer's employees, to induce the person to become a member of or act in concert with the labor organization of which the employee is a member (3) It is an unfair labor practice for any person to do or cause to be done on behalf of or in the interest of employers or employees, or in connection with or to influence the outcome of any controversy as to employment relations, any act prohibited by subs. (1) and (2). (4)  Any controversy concerning unfair labor practices may be submitted to the commission as provided in s. 111.07, except that the commission shall schedule a hearing on complaints involving alleged violations of sub. (2) (e) within 3 days after filing of a complaint, and notice shall be given to each party interested by service on the party personally, or by telegram, advising the party of the nature of the complaint and of the date, time, and place of hearing. The commission may appoint a substitute tribunal to hear unfair labor practice charges by either appointing a 3-member panel or submitting a 7-member panel to the parties and allowing each to strike 2 names. Any such panel shall report its finding to the commission for appropriate action. 111.992  Fair-share and maintenance of membership agreements. (1) (a) 1. No fair-share agreement may become effective unless authorized by a referendum. The commission shall order a referendum whenever it receives a petition supported by proof that at least 30 percent of the employees or supervisors specified in s. 111.98 (5) in a collective bargaining unit desire that a fair-share agreement be entered into between the employer and a labor organization. 2.  For a fair-share agreement to be authorized, at least a majority of the eligible employees or supervisors voting in a referendum shall vote in favor of the agreement. (b)  No maintenance of membership agreement may be effective unless authorized. For a maintenance of membership agreement to be authorized, the employer and the labor organization representing the employees must voluntarily agree to establish the maintenance of membership agreement. (c)  If a fair-share agreement is authorized in a referendum, the employer shall enter into a fair-share agreement with the labor organization named on the ballot in the referendum. If a maintenance of membership agreement is authorized under par. (b), the employer shall enter into the maintenance of membership agreement with the labor union that voluntarily agreed to establish the agreement. Each fair-share or maintenance of membership agreement shall contain a provision requiring the employer to deduct the amount of dues as certified by the labor organization from the earnings of the employees or supervisors affected by the agreement and to pay the amount so deducted to the labor organization. Unless the parties agree to an earlier date, a fair-share agreement shall take effect 60 days after the commission certifies that the referendum vote authorized the fair-share agreement and a maintenance of membership agreement shall take effect 60 days after the commission certifies that the parties have voluntarily agreed to establish the maintenance of membership agreement. The employer shall be held harmless against any claims, demands, suits, and other forms of liability made by employees or supervisors or local labor organizations which may arise for actions taken by the employer in compliance with this section. All such lawful claims, demands, suits, and other forms of liability are the responsibility of the labor organization entering into the agreement. (d)  Under each fair-share or maintenance of membership agreement, an employee or supervisor who has religious convictions against dues payments to a labor organization based on teachings or tenets of a church or religious body of which he or she is a member shall, on request to the labor organization, have his or her dues paid to a charity mutually agreed upon by the employee or supervisor and the labor organization. Any dispute concerning this paragraph may be submitted to the commission for adjudication. (2)   (a)   1.  Once authorized, a fair-share agreement shall continue in effect, subject to the right of the employer or labor organization concerned to petition the commission to conduct a new referendum. Such a petition must be supported by proof that at least 30 percent of the employees or supervisors in the collective bargaining unit desire that the fair-share agreement be discontinued. Upon so finding, the commission shall conduct a new referendum. If the continuance of the fair-share agreement is approved in the referendum by at least the percentage of eligible voting employees or supervisors required for its initial authorization, it shall be continued in effect, subject to the right of the employer or labor organization to later initiate a further vote following the procedure prescribed in this subsection. If the continuance of the fair-share agreement is not supported in any referendum, it is considered terminated at the termination of the collective bargaining agreement, or one year from the date of the certification of the result of the referendum, whichever is earlier. 2.  Once authorized, a maintenance of membership agreement shall continue in effect, subject to the right of the employer or the labor organization concerned to notify the commission that it no longer voluntarily agrees to continue the agreement. After the commission is notified, the maintenance of membership agreement is terminated at the termination of the collective bargaining agreement or one year from the notification, whichever is earlier. (b)  The commission shall declare any fair-share or maintenance of membership agreement suspended upon such conditions and for such time as the commission decides whenever it finds that the labor organization involved has refused on the basis of race, color, sexual orientation, or creed to receive as a member any employee or supervisor in the collective bargaining unit involved, and the agreement shall be made subject to the findings and orders of the commission. Any of the parties to the agreement, or any employee or supervisor covered under the agreement, may come before the commission, as provided in s. 111.07, and petition the commission to make such a finding. (3)  A stipulation for a referendum executed by an employer and a labor organization may not be filed until after the representation election has been held and the results certified. (4)  The commission may, under rules adopted for that purpose, appoint as its agent an official of a state agency whose employees are entitled to vote in a referendum to conduct a referendum under this section. 111.993 Grievance arbitration.   (1)  Parties to the dispute pertaining to the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement may agree in writing to have the commission or any other appointing state agency serve as arbitrator or may designate any other competent, impartial, and disinterested persons to so serve. Such arbitration proceedings shall be governed by ch. 788. (2)  The board shall charge an institution for the employer's share of the cost related to grievance arbitration under sub. (1) for any arbitration that involves one or more employees of the institution. Each institution so charged shall pay the amount that the board charges from the appropriation account or accounts used to pay the salary of the grievant. Funds received under this subsection shall be credited to the appropriation account under s. 20.545 (1) (km). 111.994  Mediation. The commission may appoint any competent, impartial, disinterested person to act as mediator in any labor dispute either upon its own initiative or upon the joint request of both parties to the dispute. It is the function of a mediator to bring the parties together voluntarily under such favorable auspices as will tend to effectuate settlement of the dispute, but neither the mediator nor the commission shall have any power of compulsion in mediation proceedings. 111.995 Fact-finding.   (1)  If a dispute has not been settled after a reasonable period of negotiation and after the settlement procedures, if any, established by the parties have been exhausted, the representative that has been certified by the commission after an election, as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, and the employer, its officers, and agents, after a reasonable period of negotiation, are deadlocked with respect to any dispute between them arising in the collective bargaining process, either party, or the parties jointly, may petition the commission, in writing, to initiate fact-finding under this section, and to make recommendations to resolve the deadlock. (2)  Upon receipt of a petition to initiate fact-finding, the commission shall make an investigation with or without a formal hearing, to determine whether a deadlock in fact exists. The commission shall certify the results of the investigation. If the commission decides that fact-finding should be initiated, it shall appoint a qualified, disinterested person or, when jointly requested by the parties, a 3-member panel to function as a fact finder. (3)  The fact finder may establish dates and place of hearings and shall conduct the hearings under rules established by the commission. Upon request, the commission shall issue subpoenas for hearings conducted by the fact finder. The fact finder may administer oaths. Upon completion of the hearing, the fact finder shall make written findings of fact and recommendations for solution of the dispute and shall cause the same to be served on the parties and the commission. In making findings and recommendations, the fact finder shall take into consideration among other pertinent factors the principles vital to the public interest in efficient and economical governmental administration. Upon the request of either party, the fact finder may orally present the recommendations in advance of service of the written findings and recommendations. Cost of fact-finding proceedings shall be divided equally between the parties. At the time the fact finder submits a statement of his or her costs to the parties, the fact finder shall submit a copy thereof to the commission at its Madison office. (4)  A fact finder may mediate a dispute at any time prior to the issuance of the fact finder's recommendations. (5)  Within 30 days of the receipt of the fact finder's recommendations or within a time period mutually agreed upon by the parties, each party shall advise the other, in writing, as to the party's acceptance or rejection, in whole or in part, of the fact finder's recommendations and, at the same time, send a copy of the notification to the commission at its Madison office. Failure to comply with this subsection, by the employer or employee representative, is a violation of s. 111.991 (1) (d) or (2) (c). 111.996 Strike prohibited.   (1)  Upon establishing that a strike is in progress, the employer may either seek an injunction or file an unfair labor practice charge with the commission under s. 111.991 (2) (e) or both.

CREATION OF POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE     I,… (print name, address and date of birth), being of sound mind, intend by this document to create a power of attorney for health care. My executing this power of attorney for health care is voluntary. Despite the creation of this power of attorney for health care, I expect to be fully informed about and allowed to participate in any health care decision for me, to the extent that I am able. For the purposes of this document, ""health care decision"" means an informed decision to accept, maintain, discontinue or refuse any care, treatment, service or procedure to maintain, diagnose or treat my physical or mental condition. In addition, I may, by this document, specify my wishes with respect to making an anatomical gift upon my death. DESIGNATION OF HEALTH CARE AGENT     If I am no longer able to make health care decisions for myself, due to my incapacity, I hereby designate…  (print name, address and telephone number) to be my health care agent for the purpose of making health care decisions on my behalf. If he or she is ever unable or unwilling to do so, I hereby designate… (print name, address and telephone number) to be my alternate health care agent for the purpose of making health care decisions on my behalf. Neither my health care agent nor my alternate health care agent whom I have designated is my health care provider, an employee of my health care provider, an employee of a health care facility in which I am a patient or a spouse of any of those persons, unless he or she is also my relative. For purposes of this document, ""incapacity"" exists if 2 physicians or a physician and a psychologist who have personally examined me sign a statement that specifically expresses their opinion that I have a condition that means that I am unable to receive and evaluate information effectively or to communicate decisions to such an extent that I lack the capacity to manage my health care decisions. A copy of that statement must be attached to this document. GENERAL STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY GRANTED Unless I have specified otherwise in this document, if I ever have incapacity I instruct my health care provider to obtain the health care decision of my health care agent, if I need treatment, for all of my health care and treatment.  I have discussed my desires thoroughly with my health care agent and believe that he or she understands my philosophy regarding the health care decisions I would make if I were able. I desire that my wishes be carried out through the authority given to my health care agent under this document. If I am unable, due to my incapacity, to make a health care decision, my health care agent is instructed to make the health care decision for me, but my health care agent should try to discuss with me any specific proposed health care if I am able to communicate in any manner, including by blinking my eyes. If this communication cannot be made, my health care agent shall base his or her decision on any health care choices that I have expressed prior to the time of the decision. If I have not expressed a health care choice about the health care in question and communication cannot be made, my health care agent shall base his or her health care decision on what he or she believes to be in my best interest. LIMITATIONS ON MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT My health care agent may not admit or commit me on an inpatient basis to an institution for mental diseases, an intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation, a state treatment facility or a treatment facility. My health care agent may not consent to experimental mental health research or psychosurgery, electroconvulsive treatment or drastic mental health treatment procedures for me. ADMISSION TO NURSING HOMES OR COMMUNITY-BASED RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES My health care agent may admit me to a nursing home or community-based residential facility for short-term stays for recuperative care or respite care.

A nursing home -- Yes… No… 2.  A community-based residential facility -- Yes…  No… If I have not checked either ""Yes"" or ""No"" immediately above, my health care agent may admit me only for short-term stays for recuperative care or respite care. PROVISION OF A FEEDING TUBE If I have checked ""Yes"" to the following, my health care agent may have a feeding tube withheld or withdrawn from me, unless my physician has advised that, in his or her professional judgment, this will cause me pain or will reduce my comfort. If I have checked ""No"" to the following, my health care agent may not have a feeding tube withheld or withdrawn from me. My health care agent may not have orally ingested nutrition or hydration withheld or withdrawn from me unless provision of the nutrition or hydration is medically contraindicated.     Withhold or withdraw a feeding tube -- Yes… No… If I have not checked either ""Yes"" or ""No"" immediately above, my health care agent may not have a feeding tube withdrawn from me. HEALTH CARE DECISIONS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN If I have checked ""Yes"" to the following, my health care agent may make health care decisions for me even if my agent knows I am pregnant. If I have checked ""No"" to the following, my health care agent may not make health care decisions for me if my health care agent knows I am pregnant.     Health care decision if I am pregnant -- Yes… No… If I have not checked either ""Yes"" or ""No"" immediately above, my health care agent may not make health care decisions for me if my health care agent knows I am pregnant. STATEMENT OF DESIRES, SPECIAL PROVISIONS OR LIMITATIONS In exercising authority under this document, my health care agent shall act consistently with my following stated desires, if any, and is subject to any special provisions or limitations that I specify.
