Digest                    Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau With certain limited exceptions, before being permitted to vote at any polling place, an elector currently must provide his or her name and address. If the elector is not registered, the elector must provide a specified form of proof of residence in order to register. If an elector is not able to present any required proof of residence, as an alternative, current law permits an elector's registration information to be corroborated by another qualified elector who resides in the same municipality. In addition, an elector other than a military elector or an overseas elector, as defined by federal law, who registers by mail and who has not voted in an election in this state must provide one of the forms of identification specified by federal law, or a copy thereof if voting by absentee ballot, in order to be permitted to vote. Corroboration may not be substituted for this identification requirement, but an elector who cannot provide the required identification may cast a provisional ballot. The municipal clerk or board of election commissioners must determine whether electors casting provisional ballots are qualified to vote by 4 p.m. on the day after an election. With certain limited exceptions, this bill requires each person attempting to register or vote at the polls on election day to present a valid Wisconsin driver's license issued to the person by the Department of Transportation (DOT), a valid, current identification card issued to the person by a U.S. uniformed service, or a valid Wisconsin identification card issued to the person by DOT or, if DOT implements the provisions of the federal REAL ID Act, an identification certificate issued to the person by DOT (see below). A person whose address is confidential as a result of domestic abuse or in certain cases a person who has been required by a law enforcement officer to surrender his or her license (see below) is exempted from the requirement. Under the bill, any person who applies for an absentee ballot, except a military or overseas elector, as defined by federal law, or a person whose address is confidential as a result of domestic abuse, must provide a copy of the license or identification card, unless: 1) the person has already provided a copy of his or her license or identification card in connection with an absentee ballot cast at a previous election and has not changed his or her name or address since that election; 2) the person has been required by a law enforcement officer to surrender his or her license (see below); 3) the person is indefinitely confined, in which case the person may submit a statement signed by the person who witnesses his or her absentee ballot verifying his or her identity; or 4) the person is an occupant of any nursing home, or of a communitybased residential facility, retirement home, adult family home, or residential care apartment complex where a municipality sends special voting deputies, in which case the person may submit a statement signed by the deputies verifying his or her identity. The bill continues current requirements for certain electors to provide proof of residence in order to register or to vote, but discontinues the use of corroborating electors to verify residence. If a person votes at a polling place fails to provide a license or identification card, the person may vote provisionally. If a person votes by absentee ballot and fails to provide a copy of the license or identification card, unless exempted from the requirement, the ballot is treated as a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot is marked by the poll workers, who immediately contact the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners. The person may then provide the required identification either at the polling place before the closing hour or at the office of the clerk or board. If the person does not provide the required identification to the clerk or board by 4 p.m. on the day following the election, the person's vote is not counted. If a person receives a citation from a law enforcement officer in any jurisdiction that is dated within 60 days of the date of an election and is required to surrender his or her Wisconsin operator's license at the time the citation is issued, the elector may present an original copy of the citation or notice of intent to revoke or suspend the elector's operator's license in lieu of his or her operator's license or, if the elector is voting an absentee ballot by mail, may enclose a copy of the citation or notice in lieu of a copy of his or her operator's license. In this case, the bill provides that the elector's ballot is received and counted if otherwise valid, but the ballot is marked so it can be identified during the canvassing and recount process if the validity of the ballot is questioned. The bill also directs the Government Accountability Board, in conjunction with the first regularly scheduled primary and election at which the voter identification requirements created by the bill initially apply, to conduct a public informational campaign for the purpose of informing prospective voters of the voter identification requirements created by the bill. In addition, the bill directs the board to conduct an ongoing outreach effort to identify and contact groups of electors who may need assistance in obtaining or renewing licenses or identification cards for voting purposes and to provide assistance in obtaining or renewing those licenses or identification cards. The bill also permits an elector who is eligible to obtain a Wisconsin identification card to obtain the card from DOT free of charge, if the elector specifically requests not to be charged. The bill permits an applicant to receive a Wisconsin identification card without a photograph being taken, as currently required, if the applicant provides an affidavit stating that he or she has sincerely held religious beliefs against being photographed, that he or she is a member of a religious organization or identifies with the tenets of a religious organization and names that organization, that the religious tenets of that organization prohibit such photographing, and that he or she requests the identification card for the purpose of voting. Under 2007 Wisconsin Act 20 (the biennial budget bill), certain provisions specified in the federal REAL ID Act are incorporated into state law as of May 11, 2008 or as of the date specified in a notice from DOT stating that DOT is ready to implement the federal REAL ID Act and providing the date of implementation, whichever date is later. Among these provisions is the requirement that each operator's license and identification card include a photograph. This bill creates an identification certificate to be issued by DOT beginning at the time that DOT implements the provisions of the federal REAL ID Act. A person is eligible for an identification certificate if the person provides the same information that an elector is required to provide in order to register to vote and signs a statement affirming that the information is correct. Identification certificates must be the same size as an operator's license but must be of a design that is readily distinguishable from the design of operator's licenses and identification cards. Each identification certificate must bear the words ""IDENTIFICATION CERTIFICATE."" As required by the federal REAL ID Act, identification certificates must clearly state on their face that they may not be accepted by any federal agency for federal identification or any other official purpose and must use a unique design or color indicator to alert federal agency and other law enforcement personnel that they may not be accepted for any such purpose. Each identification certificate must include a color photograph unless the identification certificate applicant provides an affidavit containing specified information, including that the applicant has a sincerely held religious belief against being photographed. An identification certificate is valid for eight years and the fee for an identification certificate is $ 18 unless the applicant requests that the identification certificate be issued without charge. The bill treats an identification certificate similarly to an identification card for some purposes and differently from an identification card for other purposes. The security standards for issuance of an identification certificate are not as strict as the standards applicable to an identification card after implementation of the federal REAL ID Act. However, when used for purposes of voting, an identification certificate has the same status as an identification card, as described above. Upon implementation of the provisions of the federal REAL ID Act, DOT may no longer issue an identification card without a photograph and a person may no longer obtain an identification card from DOT free of charge. Currently, municipalities must send two special voting deputies (one designated by each major political party if the party wishes) to conduct absentee voting in nursing homes. Municipalities may also send the deputies to conduct absentee voting in communitybased residential facilities and retirement homes that qualify for the service in accordance with standards prescribed by law. This bill permits municipal clerks and boards of election commissioners to send two special voting deputies to conduct absentee voting in adult family homes and residential care apartment complexes that qualify for the service in accordance with similar standards prescribed by law. For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.
