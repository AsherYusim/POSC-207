Text Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau This substitute amendment makes various changes in laws relating to elections and voting. Significant provisions include: Voter registration Currently, with the exception of individuals who are defined as ""military electors"" under state law and new or former residents voting for president and vice president, all eligible electors of this state must register in order to vote in an election in this state. The registration period for each election ends on the 20th day before that election, but an eligible elector may register to vote in an election after that date at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners of the municipality where he or she resides or at the polling place serving his or her residence by providing specified proof of residence. In order to register, an individual must provide his or her name, residence location, citizenship, date of birth, age, and the number of a valid Wisconsin driver's license or the last four digits of his or her social security number. An individual must also affirm that he or she: 1) has resided in his or her ward (or municipality if not divided into wards) for at least ten days; 2) has not been convicted of a felony for which he or she has not been pardoned and has not completed his or her sentence; 3) is not disqualified on any other ground from voting; and 4) is not registered to vote at any other location. The burden is on the elector to initiate registration and, if the elector's name, address, or eligibility changes, to initiate any change in registration required to maintain a valid registration. This substitute amendment makes it the responsibility of the Government Accountability Board (GAB) to use all feasible means to facilitate the registration of all eligible electors of this state who are subject to a registration requirement and the maintenance of the registration of all eligible electors for so long as they remain eligible, except as the law specifically requires electors to take some action to confirm or continue their registrations. Under the substitute amendment, GAB must attempt to facilitate the initial registration of all eligible electors in accordance with the substitute amendment's requirements and procedures no later than July 1, 2015. To assist with its responsibility, the substitute amendment directs GAB and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to enter into an agreement for the purpose of transferring specified personally identifiable information in DOT's records to GAB. The substitute amendment requires GAB to maintain the confidentiality of any information that GAB obtains under the agreement and allows a driver's license or identification card applicant to ""opt out"" of DOT's transfer of this information to GAB. Under the substitute amendment, once GAB obtains all the information required under current law to complete an elector's registration, GAB adds the elector's name to the statewide registration list. The information then becomes accessible on the Internet. No registration of an elector that is added to the list by GAB is valid until the elector confirms with GAB, on a form prescribed by GAB, that all the information pertaining to his or her registration is correct and accurate as of the date of the confirmation. The substitute amendment permits an elector to confirm a registration by any of the following means: 1) by electronic means on the Internet using a secure procedure prescribed by GAB; 2) by mail; or 3) by appearing in person at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners where the elector resides or at the polling place serving the elector's residence. Under the substitute amendment, if an elector does not confirm a registration that has been entered on his or her behalf by GAB, GAB may contact the elector in the manner determined by GAB to obtain confirmation or any necessary correction to the elector's registration. If the elector does not confirm a registration within 60 days of the date that it is entered on the registration list by GAB, GAB must contact the elector to obtain confirmation or any necessary correction. The substitute amendment also permits an individual whose name is added to the registration list by GAB or who wishes to permanently exclude his or her name from the list to file a request to have his or her name deleted or excluded from the list or to revoke a deletion or exclusion request previously made. A deletion or exclusion request or revocation of a deletion or exclusion request may be made in the manner prescribed by GAB. In addition, the substitute amendment directs GAB to notify an individual by first class postcard whenever GAB removes his or her name from the registration list or changes his or her status on the list from eligible to ineligible, other than by request of the elector, except when GAB removes a duplicate entry from the list or changes the name of a deceased person from eligible to ineligible status. Currently, if an elector is eligible to vote and is not registered to vote, the elector may register to vote and vote at the polling place serving his or her residence on election day by providing proof of residence or by having another elector of the municipality where the polling place is located corroborate his or her registration information. This substitute amendment permits an elector whose registration has been entered on the registration list by GAB to confirm his or her registration and vote on election day at the same polling place in the same manner as currently provided for original registration. Currently, a qualified elector may register to vote at any election by mail or by completing a registration form with a special registration deputy no later than the 20th day before the election. A qualified elector may also register to vote at an election in person at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners for the municipality where the elector resides no later than 5 p.m. on the day before the election. In order to register, an elector must provide his or her name and address and certain other information required to ascertain his or her eligibility and must sign the form. With certain exceptions, an elector who registers after the 20th day before an election or an elector who registers by mail and who has not voted before in an election in this state must provide proof of residence prior to voting. This substitute amendment permits a qualified elector who has a current and valid driver's license or identification card issued by DOT to register to vote at an election electronically on a secure Internet site maintained by GAB. The substitute amendment requires an electronic registration to be completed no later than the 20th day before an election in order to be valid for that election. Under the substitute amendment, GAB prescribes, by rule, the manner and method of electronic application, together with requirements for affirmation and verification of elector information and the method for receipt of electronic application forms. There is no requirement for a signature. The substitute amendment also permits an elector who is currently registered to vote and who has a current and valid driver's license or identification card to electronically enter a change of name or address using a similar procedure. Under the substitute amendment, an electronic registration is treated the same as a mail registration. The clerk or board of election commissioners of the elector's municipality of residence must verify the registration by sending a first-class letter or postcard to the registrant at the registrant's address and, if the registrant is voting for the first time in an election in this state, the registrant must provide proof of residence before voting in the election. However, the substitute amendment also provides that if an elector who registers electronically provides his or her Wisconsin driver's license number, together with his or her name and date of birth, and GAB is able to instantly verify the information electronically by electronically accessing records of DOT, the elector need not provide proof of residence prior to voting. The substitute amendment directs GAB and DOT to enter into an agreement that permits GAB to verify the necessary information instantly by accessing DOT's electronic files. Currently, each municipal clerk and board of election commissioners must maintain a file of voter registration forms for the electors of the municipality. This substitute amendment provides that the clerk or board must maintain registrations that are entered electronically in the manner prescribed by GAB, by rule. Currently, with certain exceptions, if an elector registers to vote by mail and has not voted in an election in this state, the elector must provide proof of residence prior to voting. This substitute amendment extends this requirement to apply to an elector whose registration is initiated by GAB but who has not confirmed his or her registration and has not voted in an election in this state. The substitute amendment also provides that if such an elector provides his or her Wisconsin driver's license number or the last four digits of his or her social security number, together with his or her name and date of birth, and GAB is able to instantly verify the information electronically by electronically accessing records of DOT, the elector need not provide proof of residence before voting. Currently, in order to register to vote, an elector must provide his or her date of birth. This information becomes a part of the statewide voter registration list. Information on the registration list concerning the date of birth of an elector is not open to public inspection. This substitute amendment limits this restriction only to information concerning the birthday of an elector, thus permitting public access to information concerning an elector's year of birth. The substitute amendment directs GAB to report to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature, no later than July 1, 2011, concerning its progress in initially implementing the registration system created by the substitute amendment. The report must contain an assessment of the feasibility and desirability or integration of registration information with information maintained by the departments of Health Services, Children and Families, Workforce Development, Revenue, Regulation and Licensing, and Natural Resources, the University of Wisconsin System and the State Technical College System Board as well as with the the technical colleges in each technical college district. The substitute amendment also permits GAB to enter into an agreement with any state agency to enable matching of publicly available information in the records of the agency with records of the board to facilitate administration of voter registration by GAB. In addition, the substitute amendment permits GAB to enter into an agreement with any nationally focused nonprofit organization to enable matching of information in the records of that organization with publicly available information in the records of GAB, as well as nonpublic information in the records of GAB obtained from DOT, to facilitate administration of voter registration by GAB. The agreement must require nondisclosure of any information obtained by GAB from DOT. Currently, information on the statewide voter registration list relating to the date of birth, operator's license number, or social security number of an elector, the confidential address of an elector who is subject to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking, or an accommodation required to assist a disabled elector is open to inspection only by election officials and administrators. This substitute amendment permits GAB to transfer any of this information to another state agency or authority or to a subunit of the state government of another state except information obtained from DOT. However, information obtained from DOT can be shared with a nationally focused nonprofit organization if GAB enters into an agreement with such an organization as described above. The substitute amendment also prohibits a state agency or authority or officer or employee thereof from providing access to any transferred information to a third party. Violators are subject to a forfeiture (civil penalty) of not more than $ 500 for each violation. Currently, municipal clerks and boards of election commissioners must update changes in the voter registration list received on election day no later than 30 days after the date of the election. This substitute amendment permits these changes to be updated within 45 days after a general (November) election, and further permits the legal counsel of GAB to permit a municipal clerk or board of election commissioners, upon application, to update the registration list with changes received on the date of the general election within 60 days after the date of the election. Currently, when an elector registers to vote in person at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners after the close of registration for an election, the clerk or board issues a registration certificate to the elector. This substitute amendment provides that the clerk or board shall issue a registration certificate only if the elector does not wish to cast an absentee ballot when registering. Absentee voting This substitute amendment makes various changes in the laws pertaining to absentee voting. Most of the changes relate to absentee voting by military and overseas electors of this state. State law contains different definitions of the terms ""military elector"" and ""overseas elector."" One set of definitions mirrors the definitions found in federal law. Under federal law, a ""military elector"" includes 1) a member of a uniformed service on active duty who, by reason of that duty, is absent from the residence where the member is otherwise qualified to vote; 2) a member of the merchant marine who, by reason of service in the merchant marine, is absent from the residence where the member is otherwise qualified to vote; and 3) the spouse or dependent of any such member who, by reason of the duty or service of the member, is absent from the residence where the person is otherwise qualified to vote. The federal definition of ""overseas elector"" includes an elector who resides outside the United States and who is qualified under federal law to vote in elections for national office in this state because the elector last resided in this state immediately prior to the elector's departure from the United States. The other set of definitions applies for certain state purposes and includes all the persons who are included in the federal definitions but also includes other persons. The state definition of the term ""military elector"" includes 1) members of a uniformed service who are not on active duty or who are not absent from their residences by reason of their service or both; 2) members of the merchant marine who are not absent from their residences; 3) civilian employees of the United States and civilians officially attached to a uniformed service who are serving outside the United States; 4) Peace Corps volunteers; and 5) spouses and dependents of these persons who are residing with or accompanying them. The state definition of ""overseas elector"" includes children of persons who qualify as overseas electors under federal law who are U.S. citizens at least 18 years of age, who are not disqualified from voting in this state, and who are not residents of this state. Significant provisions relating to absentee voting include: Currently, an individual who is a qualified elector of a municipality, other than a ""military elector"" or an ""overseas elector"" as defined by state law, may file an application with the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners of the municipality where the individual resides requiring the clerk or board to send an absentee ballot to the individual without further request for every succeeding election held in the same calendar year in which the request is made, or until the individual is no longer a qualified elector of the municipality or the individual otherwise requests. Currently, an elector who is indefinitely confined may file a single request to receive absentee ballots automatically for each election. If a confined elector fails to cast an absentee ballot, the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners notifies the elector that he or she will not receive absentee ballots for subsequent elections unless the elector reapplies to receive ballots within 30 days of receiving the notice. Currently, an overseas elector, as defined by state law, who requests an absentee ballot is sent an absentee ballot for all federal elections that occur in the same calendar year as the year in which the request is made, unless the elector otherwise requests. Current law directs municipal clerks and boards of election commissioners to send military electors, as defined by state law, absentee ballots for every election if they request a ballot for one election and to verify their military status without the necessity of making additional application. The clerk or board must discontinue sending absentee ballots to a military elector if the elector so requests, the elector no longer qualifies as a military elector of the municipality, or the elector fails to return at least one of the ballots sent to the elector within a period that encompasses three successive general elections. This substitute amendment directs a municipal clerk or board of election commissioners to send an absentee ballot to an individual who is a qualified elector of the municipality, other than a military elector or an overseas elector, as defined by state law, and who files a valid application to receive an absentee ballot for every election following receipt of the application until the individual no longer qualifies to receive a ballot, the individual requests not to receive ballots, or the individual fails to return absentee ballots that are mailed to the individual for two consecutive elections. Under the substitute amendment, a municipal clerk or board of election commissioners must attempt to notify any individual whose name is removed from the list of electors who automatically receive absentee ballots unless the individual requests that his or her name be removed. The individual may then request to continue to receive absentee ballots if he or she is qualified to do so. The substitute amendment also provides that an overseas elector, as defined by state law, who requests an absentee ballot shall be sent an absentee ballot for all federal elections that occur within the same year in which the ballot is requested or the subsequent year. These changes do not affect the current procedure for sending absentee ballots to military electors, as defined by state law. Currently, all electors who cast an absentee ballot, whether by mail or in person at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners, must sign a certificate that is printed on the envelope into which they deposit their ballots. The certificate certifies, subject to criminal penalties, that the elector meets specific voting qualifications and personally voted the ballot secretly unless the elector required assistance. The certificate must be witnessed by one adult U.S. citizen who also signs the certificate and certifies subject to the same penalties that the elector's statements are true, the ballot was voted as stated, and the witness did not solicit or advise the elector in casting his or her votes. This substitute amendment provides that for an elector voting an absentee ballot in person at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners or an alternate site designated by a municipality, GAB may prescribe an envelope to be used in place of the statutory certificate envelope. No witness is required on such envelopes. The substitute amendment requires GAB's envelope to include the words ""Official Absentee Ballot,"" the name of the municipality, and a space for the issuing clerk or deputy clerk to initial the envelope. Currently, the governing body of a municipality may designate a single alternate site for absentee voting in person by electors of the municipality. If designated, this site serves in lieu of the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners as the site where absentee voting is conducted for the election at which the designation is made. This substitute amendment permits the governing body of a municipality to designate more than one alternate site for absentee voting in person by electors of the municipality. Under the substitute amendment, an alternate site may be used for absentee voting in addition to or in lieu of use of the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners. The substitute amendment also directs a municipality that designates an alternate site for absentee voting at an election to notify GAB in writing of its designation. Currently, an elector who wishes to cast an absentee ballot must file a written, signed application, but the form of the application is not specified. This substitute amendment provides that an elector who wishes to cast an absentee ballot in person at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners or at an alternate site must apply on a form prescribed by GAB. Currently, the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners of a municipality must begin distributing absentee ballots to electors who have requested them no later than the 30th day before each September primary and general election and no later than the 21st day before each other primary or election. This substitute amendment retains this requirement but provides that the period for absentee voting in person at the office of the clerk or board or an alternate site begins on the 21st day before each election and ends on the day before each election. Currently, an elector who requests an absentee ballot in person or by mail must make written application and must sign the application. However, if an elector requests an absentee ballot by electronic mail or facsimile transmission, the elector need not file a written application but must enclose with his or her returned ballot a copy of a request for an absentee ballot together with his or her original signature. This substitute amendment deletes the requirement for electors who apply for an absentee ballot by electronic mail or facsimile transmission to provide a request and original signature when returning their ballots. Under current law, any qualified absentee elector may request an absentee ballot by means of electronic mail or facsimile transmission. If an elector so requests, the elector must mail with his or her voted absentee ballot a copy of an absentee ballot application containing his or her original signature. In addition, an absentee elector may request that his or her absentee ballot be transmitted to him or her by electronic mail or facsimile transmission and a municipal clerk or board of election commissioners may transmit the ballot as requested. This substitute amendment provides that the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners must transmit the ballot if the clerk or board receives a valid request. Current law permits a military or overseas elector, as defined in state law, to cast a vote in any general election in which a federal office is to be filled by writing in the name of a candidate on a blank absentee ballot form prescribed by the U.S. government and returning the ballot to the appropriate municipal clerk or board of election commissioners. This substitute amendment permits such a ballot to be cast at any election, including any primary election, at which a federal office is to be filled. This substitute amendment directs GAB, with the assistance of county and municipal clerks and boards of election commissioners, to designate at least one freely accessible means of electronic communication which shall be used to: 1) permit a military or overseas elector, as defined by federal law, to request a voter registration or absentee ballot application and to indicate whether he or she wishes to receive the application electronically or by mail; and 2) permit a municipal clerk or board of election commissioners to transmit an application to a military or overseas elector, as defined by federal law, electronically or by mail, as requested by the elector, together with related voting, balloting and election information. The substitute amendment also directs GAB, with the assistance of county and municipal clerks and boards of elections commissioners, to maintain a freely accessible system whereby a military or overseas elector who casts an absentee ballot may ascertain whether the ballot has been received by the appropriate municipal clerk or board. No similar provisions exist currently. Under current federal law, states are required to transmit absentee ballots to military and overseas electors no later than 45 days before each federal election at which the electors are entitled to vote, if the electors have requested their ballots by that time. However, a state may request a hardship waiver from the federal government, for a single election only, if the state's primary election date does not permit compliance with this requirement and the state takes other actions to ensure expeditious delivery of absentee ballots to military and overseas electors. This substitute amendment directs GAB to report to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature no later than January 1, 2011, concerning GAB's recommended method for compliance with the federal timeline for the absentee voting process. To achieve compliance, this state will likely need to advance the date of the September primary, beginning in 2012. Currently, an absentee ballot cast by an elector is void unless it is received at the polling place for the elector's residence by 8 p.m. on election night. However, state law provides that if an elector is a military elector, as defined by federal law, the elector has an additional ten days after the general election and 7 days after the September primary for the elector's ballot to be received by his or her municipality if the ballot is postmarked by election day. This substitute amendment extends a similar ten-day dispensation to military electors voting in the presidential preference primary or a special federal election. Currently, an elector who is a military elector, as defined by state law, or an overseas elector, as defined by state law, and who applies for an absentee ballot no later than 30 days before an election may cast a blank write-in ballot at that election in lieu of the official printed ballot, for any candidates for federal office whose offices are contested at that election. The ballot is valid only if it is submitted from a location outside the United States. This substitute amendment permits such an elector to cast a blank write-in absentee ballot after official printed ballots become available if he or she applies for an absentee ballot no later than the latest time permitted for application for an absentee ballot under state law. The substitute amendment also permits a military elector to cast such a ballot even if the ballot is submitted from a location inside the United States, including the elector's permanent residence. Currently, GAB must prescribe uniform instructions for absentee voters. This substitute amendment provides that the instructions must include the specific means of electronic communication that absentee voters may use to file an application for an absentee ballot, to request a voter registration form, or to change their registrations. Currently, an individual may grant the power of attorney to another individual to act on his or her behalf under certain conditions specified by the grantor. This substitute amendment specifically permits an individual who has been granted the power of attorney to act on behalf of another individual and who has authority to act on the grantor's behalf to apply for an absentee ballot on behalf of the grantor if the grantor is unable to sign an application. The substitute amendment also permits such an individual to apply for an absentee ballot on behalf of a hospitalized elector and, if the elector is not registered, to sign the elector's voter registration form on his or her behalf. In addition, the substitute amendment provides that an individual who has been granted a power of attorney to act as the agent of an elector is not permitted to cast a ballot on behalf of the elector, but if the elector has difficulty reading, writing, or understanding English or due to disability is unable to mark a ballot, the elector may request assistance in marking his or her ballot from the agent or, with certain exceptions, from another individual. Currently, the costs incurred by municipalities for mailing absentee ballots to electors and for return of the voted ballots to the municipalities is generally borne by the municipalities in which the electors reside. Postal regulations permit municipalities to use the postal system without charge for mailing and return of absentee ballots for armed forces members and certain other electors. This substitute amendment provides that if a municipality incurs costs for mailing and return of absentee ballots for electors, other than military or overseas electors, as defined by state law, who request that they be sent absentee ballots for multiple elections, the municipality may file a claim for reimbursement of those expenses with GAB and if GAB finds that the claim is substantiated, GAB must pay the claim from state general purpose revenue. Current law permits a qualified elector to apply for an absentee ballot by mail, facsimile transmission, or electronic mail. The law also specifies deadlines for receipt of applications by mail. This substitute amendment provides that the deadlines for receipt of applications by facsimile transmission or electronic mail are the same as those for receipt of applications by mail. This substitute amendment directs GAB to report to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature no later than March 1, 2011, concerning methods by which this state may be able to meet requirements for mailing and return of absentee ballots in a manner that will most effectively take advantage of potential savings that may be available to this state under applicable postal regulations. Deceptive election practices Currently, the statutes provide that no person may knowingly make or publish, or cause to be made or published, a false representation pertaining to a candidate or referendum that is intended to affect voting at an election. Violators may be fined not more than $ 1,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both. This substitute amendment prohibits any person, whether acting in an official capacity or otherwise, from intentionally deceiving any other person regarding the date, time, place, or manner of conducting an election; the qualifications for voting or restrictions on the eligibility of electors to vote in an election; or the endorsement of candidates by specified persons. Any person who violates the prohibition with intent to prevent any person from exercising the right to vote in an election may be fined not more than $ 100,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. The substitute amendment permits any person who is aggrieved by an alleged violation to obtain a court order restraining the violation. The substitute amendment also permits any person to file a sworn complaint with GAB alleging that a violation has occurred or is occurring. If GAB finds that the facts alleged in the complaint, if true, would constitute a violation, it must promptly investigate the complaint. If GAB finds that a violation has occurred or is occurring, GAB must take all measures necessary to provide correct information to electors who may have been deceived by the actions of the alleged violator and must refer the matter to the appropriate authority for prosecution. The substitute amendment also directs GAB to promulgate rules concerning corrective measures that may be appropriate whenever violations occur. In addition, the substitute amendment directs GAB to report biennially to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature with regard to violations and actions taken in response to violations. Voter intimidation, suppression, and protection Currently, no person may make use of or threaten to make use of force, violence, or restraint in order to compel any person to vote or refrain from voting at an election, and no person may, by any act compel, induce, or prevail upon an elector to either vote or refrain from voting at any election for or against a particular candidate or question. Violators may be fined not more than $ 10,000 or imprisoned for not more than three years and six months, or both. This substitute amendment provides that no person may make use of or threaten to make use of force, violence, restraint, or any tactic of coercion or intimidation in order to induce or compel any person to vote or refrain from voting or to refrain from registering to vote at an election, and no person may use or threaten to use force or violence or by use of any threat of any act of coercion or intimidation compel, induce, or prevail upon an elector either to vote or refrain from voting at any election for or against a candidate or question. Violators may be fined not more than $ 100,000 or imprisoned for not more than three years, or both. The substitute amendment also provides that no person may knowingly attempt to prevent or deter another person from voting or registering to vote based upon fraudulent, deceptive, or spurious grounds or information. Violators may be fined not more than $ 50,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both. Currently, municipal clerks and boards of election commissioners are directed by law to post specified materials at each polling place. GAB is directed to publish a manual that may be easily understood by the general public explaining the duties of election officials. Currently, GAB is also directed to ensure that in any jurisdiction in this state that is required under federal law to provide voting materials in a language other than English, the voting system used in that jurisdiction is in compliance with federal law. There is no specific penalty for violations, but the requirements are enforceable administratively and through the court system. This substitute amendment creates a voter's bill of rights and directs municipal clerks and boards of election commissioners to post a copy of the bill of rights at each polling place unless otherwise permitted by GAB. The substitute amendment directs GAB to include a number of specific items in its manual. The substitute amendment also requires that at each polling place located in a jurisdiction that is required under federal law to provide voting materials in a language other than English, all required postings must be made in that language as well as in English unless otherwise permitted by GAB. See Polling place posting requirements, below. In addition, the substitute amendment directs the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners of any such jurisdiction to contact and coordinate with organizations that advocate for the rights of individuals who speak that language to ensure that each polling place in the jurisdiction adequately serves the needs of these individuals, and to endeavor to ensure that at least one of the election officials who serves at each polling place in the jurisdiction speaks that language. Violators are subject to a forfeiture (civil penalty) of not more than $ 500 for each violation. The substitute amendment also permits, with limited exceptions, any elector of this state to sue for injunctive relief, a court order requiring or prohibiting certain action, or any other appropriate relief, to compel compliance with the substitute amendment's prohibitions and requirements relating to voter intimidation, suppression, and protection. Currently, an elector may be required to pursue administrative relief before filing suit, and in some cases must petition a district attorney or the attorney general to file suit on his or her behalf. Residency of election officials Currently, with certain exceptions, an election official who serves at a polling place must be an elector of the ward or election district served by the polling place. A special registration deputy who serves at a polling place may be an elector of another ward or election district within the municipality where the deputy serves. With certain limitations, a pupil who is 16 or 17 years of age may serve as an election official at the polling place serving his or her residence. A special voting deputy who supervises voting at a nursing home, retirement home, or community-based residential facility must be an elector of the municipality where the home or facility is located. An official who serves at a polling place may be replaced in case of a temporary vacancy by an individual who is an elector of a ward or election district other than a ward or election district that is served by the polling place where the individual serves. With certain limitations, a municipal clerk or deputy clerk who resides outside of a municipality may also serve as an election official in that municipality when required to fill a temporary vacancy. This substitute amendment provides that an election official must be an elector of the county, or one of the counties, where the municipality where the official serves is located. Under the substitute amendment, a municipal clerk or deputy clerk who is an elector of this state may continue to serve as an election official in case of a temporary vacancy without regard to county residence. The substitute amendment permits a special voting deputy to be an elector of the county, or one of the counties, where the municipality in which the deputy serves is located. The substitute amendment also permits a pupil who is 16 or 17 years of age to serve as an election official at a polling place serving any municipality located wholly or partly within the county within which the pupil resides. Polling place posting requirements Currently, the law requires a number of notices to be posted at each polling place on election day. The notices include the date and hours of the election, sample ballots, local area maps, voting instructions, election fraud laws, warnings about mismarking ballots in ways that will void them, and other information prescribed by GAB. This substitute amendment adds two new posting requirements (see Voter intimidation, suppression, and protection, above). The substitute amendment also permits GAB, directly or by delegation to its legal counsel, to authorize another means of providing notice to affected electors of the information required to be posted, including the new information specified in the substitute amendment, if GAB determines that the alternative means of providing notice is at least as effective as posting. Prosecution of civil prohibited practice offenses Currently, with limited exceptions, prosecutions of prohibited election practice offenses are conducted by the appropriate district attorney, or in certain cases, by the attorney general. Most of these offenses are criminal, but a few of them are civil offenses. This substitute amendment provides that, with limited exceptions, prosecutions of civil prohibited election practice offenses, including the one created by this substitute amendment (see Voter intimidation, suppression, and protection, above), may be prosecuted either by GAB or by the appropriate district attorney. Challenging the ballots of electors at polling places Currently, any elector may challenge for cause the right of any other elector to vote at a polling place if the challenger knows or suspects that the challenged elector is not a qualified elector. The inspectors of election (poll workers) must then administer oaths to both the challenger and the challenged elector concerning the challenged elector's qualifications. If the inspectors receive the ballot of any elector who has been challenged, they must mark the ballot with the elector's serial number. If canvassing an election, a board of canvassers may review and decide any challenge and may count or reject a challenged ballot accordingly. If a petition for a recount is filed, the board of canvassers may again review and decide whether a challenged ballot is cast by a qualified elector and may count or reject the ballot accordingly. An elector may also challenge the ballot of an absent elector before the inspectors at a polling place or before a board of absentee ballot canvassers in municipalities where absentee ballots are not canvassed at polling places. The challenged elector need not be present when the challenge is made. This substitute amendment provides that only an elector who resides in the same county as the one in which a challenged elector resides may challenge the ballot of that elector and, if the challenged elector is an elector of a first class city, only an elector who resides in the same aldermanic district as the one in which the challenged elector resides may challenge the ballot of that elector. The substitute amendment, however, permits a district attorney to challenge the ballot of any elector within the prosecutorial district served by the district attorney. The substitute amendment directs the inspectors or board of absentee ballot canvassers to require the challenging elector to provide proof of residence, as defined by law, when making a challenge. Withholding of voluntarily provided elector information Currently, GAB and municipal clerks must provide public access to information in their records unless otherwise provided by law or unless the custodian demonstrates that the public interest in withholding public access outweighs the strong public interest in providing that access. This substitute amendment provides that whenever GAB or a county or municipal clerk or board of election commissioners has the telephone number, facsimile transmission number, or electronic mail address of an elector that is voluntarily provided by the elector to GAB or to the clerk or board, GAB and the clerk and board are prohibited from providing access to that information except to election officials and employees to be used for the administration of elections. Automatic tabulating equipment testing Currently, if a municipality uses an electronic voting system at an election that employs automatic tabulating equipment, the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners must conduct a public test not more 10 days before the election to ensure that the equipment correctly counts votes. This substitute amendment permits the test to be conducted at any time after ballots become available prior to the date of the election. Proof of residence Currently, an elector must provide proof of residence in a form specified by law for various registration and voting purposes. The purposes include voter registration after the close of registration for an election (5 p.m. on the 20th day before the election) and voting for the first time in this state after registering by mail. In order for a specified form of proof to be valid, the proof must contain the current and complete name of the elector and the elector's current and complete address. However, if a student at a university, college, or technical college presents a fee or identification card, and the university, college, or technical college provides a current list of students residing in housing sponsored by the university, college, or technical college to a municipal clerk, and the municipal clerk, special registration deputy, or inspector (poll worker) verifies that the name of the student presenting a card appears on the list, the card need not contain the required information in order to be valid. This substitute amendment provides that if an elector registers to vote at the office of the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners or an alternate absentee voting site when voting an absentee ballot in person (beginning on the 21st day before an election), the elector must provide proof of residence even if registration for that election has not closed when the elector registers to vote. The substitute amendment also provides that a municipal clerk, special registration deputy, or inspector must accept a university, college, or technical college fee or identification card presented by a student as proof of residence for registration or voting at an election if the student's university, college, or technical college has provided to the municipal clerk a current list of students residing in housing sponsored by the university, college, or technical college and the student's name appears on the list. Review of encumbrances and expenditures by Joint Committee on Finance Currently, the the legislature has made appropriations to the GAB for the operation of the board in the current fiscal biennium. This substitute amendment does not change these appropriations. However, the substitute amendment provides that before GAB may encumber or expend any amount of money to implement or administer any provision of the act resulting from enactment of this substitute amendment, GAB's legal counsel must first notify the cochairpersons of the Joint Committee on Finance of the proposed encumbrance or expenditure. The proposed encumbrance or expenditure is then subject to approval of or modification by the committee, but the committee may waive its right to review any proposed encumbrance or expenditure. The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows: 5.05 (1) (e) of the statutes is amended to read: Delegate to its legal counsel the authority to intervene in a civil action or proceeding under sub.
