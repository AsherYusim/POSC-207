SECTION 2. IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT TO VOTE. (b)  Any person desiring to vote in this state shall present proof of identity to the election official when appearing to vote in person either early or at the polls on Election Day.

(B)  Request that the voter execute an affidavit in the presence of the election official containing:
 
(i)  A written eligibility affirmation stating that he or she is a registered voter in the precinct in which he or she desires to vote and is eligible to vote; and
 
(ii)  A statement that the voter cannot provide proof of identity because the voter:
 
(a)  Does not have proof of identity available at the time of voting;
 
(b)  Is indigent; or
 

 
(c)  Has a religious objection to being photographed. 
 
(2)  If a voter executes an affidavit under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section, the election official shall permit the voter to cast a provisional ballot.

(2)  The voter has not been challenged or required to vote a provisional ballot for any other reason.

SECTION 3. REPEALS.  The following are repealed: ________.
 
SECTION 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.   This [act] takes effect _______.
 
[i]In its Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, ALEC also outlines suggested requirements for proof of citizenship when registering to vote. [ii]Because numerous United States Supreme Court decisions have been interpreted to hold that government may not require citizens to pay any fee in exchange for the right to vote, bill drafters may wish to include a section that mandates the provision of publicly funded ID cards without cost to those citizens who request them.
